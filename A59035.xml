            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who knoweth all the Treaſures of Grace and Comforts, which are comprized in the Covenant of Gods free and rich Mercy, made in Jeſus Chriſt?

Therefore prize with thanks, and improve with diligence, this and ſuch-like holy helps, which Divine Providence putteth into thine hand.

God promiſeth life and all good to man, and man promiſeth all obedience to God; God promiſeth what he pleaſeth, and requireth what he pleaſeth, and man promiſeth unto God what God requireth.</p>
                     <p>And here by the way note, that in every Covenant betwixt God and man, the whole draught of it <hi>depends upon the Soveraigne will and pleaſure of God,</hi> who propoſeth what rewards he pleaſeth, and impoſeth what termes he pleaſeth, and draws up the Covenant in what termes he pleaſeth. And the reaſon hereof lies
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55323:4"/>
in the <hi>abſolute power</hi> and <hi>authority of God</hi> over man, who is infinitely inferiour to God, and wholly ſubordinate to him; and therefore man may not indent with him, by propoſing Articles of Agreement, but he muſt accept what the Lord is pleaſed to propoſe, either by way of duty on mans part, or by way of promiſe on Gods part. And well he may do ſo, inreſpect of that <hi>Infinite Goodneſſe and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in God,</hi> who knows much better how to lay the frame of a Covenant betwixt himſelf and man, than man can know how to draw a Covenant betwixt himſelf and God.</p>

                     <p>The cauſes thereof amongſt many others may be theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To put an honour upon his people.</hi> Some do derive the word <hi>Berith,</hi> (which ſignifies the Covenant) from a root which ſignifies to <hi>purifie,</hi> and to <hi>ſeparate,</hi> and to <hi>ſelect;</hi> and verily, the Lord when he makes a Covenant with any, he doth ſeparate them from others, looks on them, takes them and ownes them for <hi>his peculiar people,</hi> and agrees with them as the choſen and choyceſt of all others. The firſt <hi>ſtaffe</hi> in <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 10. is called <hi>beauty,</hi> and this was <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> And indeed it is a high honour to be in Covenant with God, there is a fourfould honour to us in this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One in that <hi>God in this becomes ours, and we are made nigh unto him.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond in that <hi>God is ours,</hi> and <hi>we his</hi> in a very <hi>peculiar way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That we might be encouraged in our whole courſe of obedience;</hi> there being ſufficiency promiſed, and ſecurity enough given by God in this Covenant for all <note place="margin">To encourage us in obedience</note> good, unto all ſuch who are faithful in Covenant with him. <hi>Walk before me and be thou perfect, and I will be a God al-ſufficient unto thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. <hi>All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth to them that keep his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25. 10.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That we might <hi>be bound faſt unto himſelf;</hi> the Covenant binds faſt on both parts; <hi>God binds himſelf to us,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> alſo <hi>are bound by it to him,</hi> Jer. 13. 11. <note place="margin">To bind us faſt to God.</note>

There is <hi>Foedus abſolutum,</hi> which is ſuch a promiſe of God, as takes in no ſtipulation or condition at all, that <note place="margin">There is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> runnes altogether upon <hi>abſolute termes;</hi> ſuch a Covenant was that which <hi>God made with Noah, that he would never drown the world any more,</hi> Gen. 9. 11. and ſuch a kind of Covenant is that, when <hi>God promiſeth to give faith and perſeverance unto his elect,</hi> Heb. 8. 10, &amp;c. Both theſe Covenants are abſolute, and without any condition; there is nothing in them but what is folded up in the promiſes themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Foedus Hypotheticum,</hi> which is a <hi>gracious promiſe</hi> on Gods part, with an <hi>obligation to duty</hi> on our part; for although it be natural to God, to <hi>recompence</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">And an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> any good, as it is to puniſh any evil; And although man doth <hi>owe unto God</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God covenanteth with him for; yet it ſo pleaſeth his Divine Will thus to deale with us, that <hi>in binding of us to duty</hi> unto himſelf, he <hi>binds himſelf in reward</hi> unto us, and promiſeth ſuch and ſuch a recompence, upon the condition of ſuch and ſuch a performance.</p>
                  <p>Now this kind of Covenant is twofold. <note place="margin">The Covenant is either The Covenant of nature;</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Foedus Naturae,</hi> (as ſome ſtile it) or <hi>Foedus operum, the Covenant of works</hi> as we uſually call it; the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>Law of works,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. This is the Covenant which God made with <hi>man</hi> in <hi>the ſtate of innocency</hi> before the fall;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55323:6"/>
wherein God promiſed unto man life and happineſſe, upon condition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and perſonal obedience; and it is ſummed up by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Do this and live.</hi> God having created man upright after his own Image, and ſo having furniſhed him with all abilities ſufficient for obedience, thereupon he made a Covenant with him for life upon the condition of obedience; I ſay, he made ſuch a Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> as <hi>a publick perſon;</hi> and as he promiſed <hi>life</hi> to him and his poſterity, in caſe of obedience, ſo he <hi>threatened death</hi> and a <hi>curſe</hi> unto him and his poſterity in caſe of diſobedience. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. <hi>Curſedis every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faedus Gratiae,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>law of faith,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</note> Rom. 3. 27. and it is eſpecially expreſſed thus, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11.</p>
                  <p>This is that Covenant of which the Text ſpeaks, and of which (by Gods aſſiſtance) <note place="margin">This is ſtiled</note> I intend to diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>This Covenant, which is ſometimes ſtiled <hi>the Covenant of life;</hi> life is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">The Covenant of life.</note> and life is promiſed, and life is ſetled by the Covenant; no life for a ſinner out of it.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes it is ſtiled <hi>a Covenant of peace;</hi> Numb. 25. 12. <hi>Behold I give</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Covenant of peace.</note> 
                     <hi>unto him my Covenant of Peace. Peace</hi> is the <hi>comprehenſion of all bleſſings</hi> and proſperity; our good is in this good Covenant of grace; and all peace flowes out of it, <hi>peace with God,</hi> and <hi>peace of coſncience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſometimes it is called <hi>a Covenant of ſalt,</hi> Num. 18. 19. 2 Chron. 13. 5. A <note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> Covenant of ſalt.</note> firm, ſure, uncorruptible Covenant which laſts for ever.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is ſtiled <hi>the promiſe,</hi> Pſal. 105. 42. <hi>He remembred his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The promiſe.</note> and <hi>Abraham his ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is called <hi>the promiſe by way of eminency;</hi> it is made up altogether of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; all on <hi>Gods part,</hi> which he will do, is under promiſe; and all on <hi>our part</hi> which we are to do, is likewiſe under promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is called the mercy and the truth, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>Thou wilt perform</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The mercy and the truth.</note> 
                     <hi>the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Covenant is called <hi>mercy,</hi> becauſe mercy only drew this Covenant; It was meer mercy which moved God to make new bonds with us, yea all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is wrapped up in it. And it is called <hi>Truth,</hi> becauſe the Lord God who makes this Covenant, will certainly and truly performe all that good and mercy, which (in it) he makes over unto his people.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo it is called <hi>the oath,</hi> Luke 2. 73. <hi>The oath which he ſware unto</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Oath.</note> 
                     <hi>our father Abraham.</hi> You do not read of <hi>Gods Oath</hi> in the Covenant of works (that Covenant wanted a Mediatour, and was not ſealed with an oath) but in this Covenant of grace there is the oath of God, to declare unto us, and to confirm us, as touching the immutability of his will and purpoſe, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all that good mentioned in this Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And it is called a Teſtament, and a <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> Matth. 26. 28. <hi>My</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A Teſtament, and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

There are <hi>precious Legacies</hi> beſtowed and ſetled by God the Father in this Covenant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his children, and all of them are confirmed and ratified to them by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This Covenant of grace (thus gloriouſly ſet out in the Scripture) wherein God proclaimes all his goodneſſe to us, which is the foundation of all our lives and comforts, hopes and happineſſe, which is the foundation of all godlineſſe and holy walking, which is a ſure and our only anchor, I am now in a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct way to diſcourſe of.</p>

Although that Covenant of works (as it is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life) ceaſeth unto believers, yet it ſtands in force, upon and againſt all unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, notwithſtanding all theſe general concordancies, correſpondencies, and agreements between them, they do yet differ in nine particulars; which I <note place="margin">Nine things in which they differ.</note> ſhall the rather mention, that you may underſtand the infinite goodneſſe of God in making this Covenant of grace; and his infinite mercy in it, and your own happineſſe by it, if any of you be brought into the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And alſo to affect your hearts, that you may preſs the more after a perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein.</p>
                  <p>Thus then the Covenant of works and of grace do differ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In their ſpecial end.</hi> The end which God aimed at in the Covenant of works, was, <hi>the declaration and magnifying of his juſtice;</hi> and his end in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">In their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al end.</note> the Covenant of grace, is <hi>the declaration and magnifying of his mercy. In the Covenant of works,</hi> it is, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> if you ſinne, you dye for it: Here is no place for Repentance, no place for mercy. In the Covenant of works, when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, there was no commiſſion of enquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he repented or not of what he had done; the enquiry was only of the fact, <hi>What haſt thou done? Haſt thou eaten of the tree, whereof I ſaid unto thee, Thou ſhalt not eat?</hi> and being found guilty, death and curſe are pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 11, 19. Thus it is in the Covenant of works. <hi>The ſoul</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55323:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>that ſinnes ſhall die,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 18. 4. In this, <hi>God reveals his wrath from heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all unrighteouſneſſe and ungodlineſſe of men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. And thus he makes his power and juſtice known in that Covenant. But in <hi>the Covenant of grace,</hi> his intention and purpoſe is to glorifie his mercy, to proclaim his glory. <hi>The Lord, The Lord merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſs and truth; forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſinne,</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe dayes, &amp;c. I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities I will remember no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 10, 12.</p>
                  <p>In this Covenant, there is place for repentance, and mercy for the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Repent, that your ſinnes may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>He that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his ſins ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13. So that as to the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> you muſt be altogether perfect, and alwayes ſo; if you ſinne at all, you are caſt and condemned; But as to <hi>the Covenant of grace,</hi> the ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penitent, is received to mercy, and ſpared. This is one great difference betwixt the Covenant of Works and of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the condition of man, with whom God doth Covenant. The Covenant</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man with whom God doth Covenant</note> 
                     <hi>of works</hi> was made with man as <hi>perfect, upright, innocent,</hi> and then ſinleſſe; and therefore it is called by ſome, <hi>Pactum Amicitiae,</hi> a <hi>Covenant of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi> becauſe before the fall, there was nothing of variance or enmity betwixt God and man; that eſtate was an eſtate of love and kindneſſe, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; <hi>God</hi> was <hi>Adams friend,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>a friend to God;</hi> they agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and converſed as loving friends. But <hi>the Covenant of grace,</hi> was made with man as <hi>breaking friendſhip,</hi> as fallen off by ſinne; as under the eſtate of emnity, when his ſinnes had ſeparated betwixt him and his God; and therefore <hi>this Covenant</hi> is called <hi>Pactum Reconciliationis, a Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> an agreement made betwixt parties who had fallen out. The Lord was pleaſed to look after man again, and to take pity on him, and to propoſe new Articles of life unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In their foundations. The Covenant of works</hi> (as to our part) was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">In their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</note> upon <hi>the strength of that righteous nature</hi> which God gave unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him unto us: ſo that his ſtanding was upon his own bottome, upon the ſufficiency of his own power and will, with which he was created. But the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>the Covenant of grace is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not our own ſtrength, but the ſtrength of Chriſt who is the <hi>Rock,</hi> the <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi> the <hi>foundation-ſtone,</hi> upon which you are built. And this is one reaſon why <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and loſt that life promiſed in the Covenant of works; and why ſuch as are brought into the Covenant of grace fall not, ſo as to loſe that bleſſed life promiſed unto them. <hi>Adam</hi> had more inherent ſtrength of grace than we have; he at his firſt creation was without all ſinne, yet he being left to the ſtrength of his own will, willingly brake with God, willingly tranſgreſſed, and loſt all; But we, though weaker in our ſelves than he, yet being brought into this Covenant of grace, though we meet with as great temptations as he, yet fall not as he did, becauſe the foundation of our ſtrength is greater than his. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt holds us in his own hands,</hi> Joh. 10. 28. <hi>And we are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Covenant of works was made without a Mediatour.</hi> There was no <note place="margin">The one made without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</note> 
                     <hi>dayes-man</hi> betwixt God and man, none to ſtand between them; There was none, and needed none, becauſe there was no difference then betwixt God and man; Man was then righteous, perfectly righteous; A Mediatour is a third perſon betwixt two different parties, to make up the breach which ariſeth betwixt them; but when the Covenant of works was made betwixt God and man, all was righteouſneſſe; and therefore all was peace; there was no uſe of a Mediatour to bring them into peace, and ſet them at one, who were hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in perfect love and union. But <hi>in the Covenant of grace there is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The other with a Mediatour.</note>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55323:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Jeſus the Mediatour of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen, there is now a neceſſity of a Mediatour to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, to deſtroy enmity, to make peace, to bring us neare to God again, and to gain us confidence and acceptance with God. The Covenant of grace, could not have been drawn up without a Mediatour; God would never have treated with ſinners but by a Mediatour, who ſhould ſatisfie him for the wrong and injury done unto him, and who ſhould ſet mercy (as it were) at liberty, to ſhowr and fall down on ſinful man, and who ſhould undertake to ſee all Articles performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> It may be objected, that <hi>the Law given at Mount Sinai,</hi> was a Covenant of works, and yet that <hi>was delivered by the hand of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> Gal. 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more to this at preſent, but that the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> though <hi>materially</hi> it <hi>reſpected works,</hi> yet <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>intentionally,</hi> it <hi>was not</hi> then <hi>given</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed as a Covenant of works,</hi> by which we ſhould be juſtified and live; this I ſhall afterwards make evident, and therefore ſhall ſay no more unto it at the preſent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> do differ <hi>in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</note> 
                     <hi>of life promiſed in both. Life</hi> is promiſed in both Covenants, but upon <hi>different conditions. Do this and live,</hi> ſaith the Covenant of works; <hi>Believe on Jeſus Chriſt and live,</hi> ſaith the Covenant of grace. The condition of the one, conſiſts in <hi>giving;</hi> The condition of the other, conſiſts <hi>in receiving;</hi> The condition of the one, is to <hi>give in a perfect righteouſneſs of our own unto God;</hi> and the condition of the other is, <hi>by faith to receive a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from Chriſt.</hi> In the Covenant of nature or of works, there is <hi>forum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae,</hi> where the <hi>ſentence of abſolution</hi> paſſeth if we be found righteous; and the <hi>ſentence of condemnation,</hi> if we be found unrighteous; the queſtion is not then about <hi>faith,</hi> but <hi>love;</hi> not whether you <hi>believ'd,</hi> but whether you <hi>obey'd.</hi> But in the Covenant of grace, there is <hi>forum miſericordiae;</hi> and the <hi>ſentence of abſolution,</hi> paſſeth not upon our <hi>doing,</hi> but upon our <hi>believing;</hi> and the <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation</hi> paſſeth upon all unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>Now here fall in two notable queſtions.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Whither faith were not required in the Covenant of works? <note place="margin">Whether faith were not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works. How faith was rerequired.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I anſwer three things.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Faith was required</hi> in the Covenant of works, as Faith may be taken, either <hi>for a dependance on God</hi> the only Authour of being and bleſſing, or for <hi>an expectation</hi> of <hi>that good of life,</hi> which God promiſed with a <hi>reliance upon God for it;</hi> or for a <hi>perſwaſion of Gods love</hi> to him, and acceptance of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whil'ſt continuing upright with God. As to theſe conſiderations of faith, <hi>Adam</hi> (who lived under the Covenant of works) had faith, and did exerciſe it: for he was bound to acknowledge God as the only fountaine of his good, and to depend upon him as ſo: And he was bound to believe the poſſeſſion of that life which God promiſed to him, whil'ſt he ſhould continue perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient: and likewiſe he was bound to be perſwaded of the love of God unto him in that courſe of obedience, and alſo the acceptance of his obediential ſervices unto God.</p>
                  <p>2. But that <hi>faith which respected the Covenant of works,</hi> was <hi>different from that faith which respects the Covenant of grace,</hi> and is now required. For, 1. <note place="margin">How not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> 
                     <hi>That faith was ſuch as looked on a promiſe of life made by God to a perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and as ſo continuing; but that <hi>faith</hi> which reſpects the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> looks upon <hi>the promiſe of God in Chriſt,</hi> made in reſpect to us ſinners, and loſt in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>2. That <hi>faith looked on God as a creatour,</hi> and preſerver, but <hi>this faith</hi> looks on <hi>God as a Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>merciful Father.</hi>
                  </p>

3. <hi>That faith</hi> was <hi>natural,</hi> concreated with <hi>Adam,</hi> not raiſed, nor infuſed in a Goſpel-way: but <hi>this faith</hi> is now <hi>promiſed,</hi> and <hi>infuſed in a ſupernatural way,</hi> by the Spirit of Chriſt, through the diſpenſation of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>That faith could not be at all in any,</hi> but <hi>ſo long</hi> as he was <hi>perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> and therefore it ceaſed upon the ceſſation of that righteouſneſſe; it was principally grounded upon inherent Righteouſneſſe. But, <hi>this faith is in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> who hath no righteouſneſſe of his own, but <hi>relies upon the righteouſneſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> even the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Although there was a <hi>kind of faith in Adam</hi> under the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Faith not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in both, for the ſame end.</note> yet <hi>that faith was not for this end and purpoſe,</hi> to be the condition of that Covenant. There it was a <hi>part of his righteouſneſſe,</hi> but was not ſtipulated as the condition of life, as that upon which his life and juſtification did depend. But the <hi>faith</hi> required in the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> comes in purpoſely as the <hi>condition of life,</hi> and <hi>juſtification for the ſinner.</hi>

                  <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whither the <hi>Covenant of grace</hi> doth not <hi>require works,</hi> as well <note place="margin">Whether the Covenant of grace requires works.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Queſtionleſſe, the <hi>Covenant of grace requires good works. This is a faithful ſaying (ſaith Paul,</hi> Tit. 3. 8.) <hi>and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which believe in God, might be careful to maintain good works; theſe things are good and profitable unto men. Let your light ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they may ſee your good works,</hi> Matth. 5. 16. But yet <hi>there is a vaſt difference</hi> betwixt the good works as required in the Covenant of works, <note place="margin">But with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> and as required in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>They differ in their <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>fountain,</hi> and they differ in <hi>their manner of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Wherein this difference lies.</note> 
                     <hi>working;</hi> but herein eſpecially they differ as to theſe Covenants; that <hi>in the one,</hi> they are <hi>a condition of life;</hi> but <hi>in the other, Teſtimonies and Evidences of life;</hi> in the one, they are <hi>the matter of life</hi> and <hi>juſtification;</hi> in the other, <hi>they are nothing at all;</hi> they are no part, no reaſon, they have no intreſt or hand at all in the juſtification of a ſinner; <hi>Faith</hi> (therein) <hi>wholly excludes them,</hi> and fixeth only on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. Although they are <hi>alwayes preſent in the juſtified man,</hi> yet they are <hi>never preſent in his juſtification</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
                  <p>6. The Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace do differ thus; <hi>The</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In the one, the leaſt ſin undoes the ſinner.</note> 
                     <hi>least ſin undoes the ſinner under the Covenant of works,</hi> but it <hi>doth not ſo in the Covenant of grace.</hi> The Covenant of works paſſeth ſentence againſt you, upon the leaſt obliquity; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in every thing to do it;</hi> and you have no remedy againſt this ſentence in the Covenant of works: But it is <hi>not ſo in the Covenant of grace.</hi> This is a <hi>Remedy,</hi> and a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and a <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> againſt the ſentence paſſed in the Covenant of works. <note place="margin">In the other there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</note> If the condemned and diſtreſſed ſinner, can fly unto, and reach to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, Chriſt will ſatisfie for him, and make his peace, and procure mercy for him. Nay, the <hi>Covenant of grace deals more favourably with us;</hi> It doth not caſt us out for every tranſgreſſion, but as a <hi>father pities his child that ſerves him,</hi> ſo <hi>doth the Lord pity them that feare him,</hi> Pſal. 103. 13. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we utterly violate the Covenant of grace, we may yet find grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>The Covenant of works,</hi> if we could attain unto it, <hi>would now be matter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The one would be matter of glorying in our ſelves.</note> 
                     <hi>of glorying in our ſelves; If Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory,</hi> Rom. 4. 2. <hi>The elder brother</hi> (who repreſented theſe <hi>work-men)</hi> how did he boaſt himſelf? <hi>Theſe many years did I ſerve thee, neither tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsed I at any time thy Commandment, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 15. 29. <hi>I am not as other men,</hi> ſaid that <hi>proud Phariſee;</hi> you might have challenged life by a debt, by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55323:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Covenant of works; <hi>To him that worketh, is the Reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. You might have earned happineſſe, if I may ſo ſpeak, at your fingers ends, and might have demanded your wages after you had done your work; But, <hi>the Covenant of grace cuts off all boasting, and glorying</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The other cuts off all boaſting</note> 
                     <hi>in our ſelves. Where is boaſting then? it is excluded; by what Law? of works; nay, but by the Law of faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. <hi>And Jeſus Chriſt is made unto us of God, Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification and Redemption; That according as it is written, he that glorieth, might glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31. You cannot glory in your <hi>wiſdome,</hi> for that you have from Chriſt; nor in your <hi>ſanctification,</hi> for that you have from Chriſt, &amp;c. you have all from Chriſt, therefore all your glorying muſt be in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>twofold glorying,</hi> one in <hi>the Teſtimony of conſcience;</hi> this you may have who are under the Covenant of grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Another is <note place="margin">A twofold glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.</note> in the <hi>confidence of our own works.</hi> This the Covenant of grace doth utterly exclude. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Gal. 6. 14. All is of grace; by the Covenant of grace, all is given, and freely given. Chriſt is given, and grace is given, and mercy is given, and life is given, and ſalvation is given; and therefore all boaſting and glorying in our ſelves, is excluded by the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>8. They differ thus; <hi>The Covenant of works breeds terrours and fear,</hi> and <note place="margin">The one breeds fear and terror.</note> 
                     <hi>despair;</hi> If a man expect life by it, his heart muſt ſink within him, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſhort he is of that righteouſneſſe therein required for life, as alſo that abundance of unrighteouſneſſe in himſelf, expoſing him to wrath, from a juſt God.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> is a <hi>miniſtration of life and peace, and joy,</hi> and <note place="margin">The other is a miniſtration of life.</note> 
                     <hi>boldneſſe;</hi> you have here a ſure refuge to fly unto, a ſure Rock to ſtand upon, and a ſure Anchor to truſt unto.</p>
                  <p>9. There are many other differences between them; as the <hi>impoſſibility of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſummed up.</note> 
                     <hi>life</hi> by the one, as the caſe now ſtands; and the <hi>certainty of life</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the <hi>diverſity of life</hi> promiſed in the one, from that in the other; and a difference in reſpect of the <hi>ſeals</hi> for the one, and for the other; And a difference in reſpect of <hi>extent.</hi> The Covenant of works was with all men, but this with believers only. And a difference <hi>in reſpect of Appeals;</hi> though you may appeal from the Covenant of works to the Covenant of grace, yet there is no appeal from the Covenant of grace, &amp;c. But I ſhall not ſtay any longer upon this firſt particular, only by the way make ſome few Uſes from the conſideration of both theſe Covenants.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Uſe.</hi> In what a <hi>miſerable condition are all unbelievers,</hi> and <hi>impenitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> who are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>forreiners</hi> to the Covenant of grace, enemies to Chriſt, and therefore utterly diſintereſted in the Covenant of grace. Surely, <note place="margin">In what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</note> mercy is not to be found in any other Covenant but in this. In the Covenant of works you are condemned and accurſed, by reaſon of tranſgreſſion; your lives are forfeited, you are under the curſe <hi>(curſed is every one, &amp;c.)</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Covenant of works mitigate or reverſe, or alter the ſentence: It admits of no mercy at all. Mercy which is the only remedy againſt it, is found only in the Covenant of grace. There is the <hi>Throne of grace</hi> ſet up, and there is the <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> to be found. But unbelievers, becauſe they refuſe Chriſt; and impenitent ſinners becauſe they chooſe their ſinnes, exclude themſelves from Chriſt and from this Covenant of grace; and therefore they ſhall live and die ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed and condemned men.</p>

The Covenant of works (by which if you will be juſtified) ſuppoſeth perſonal, perfect and ſtedfaſt righteouſneſſe; neither admits it of any repentance, nor will it make a new compoſition with you after your ſinnings; but as it will clear and acquit you upon perfect and ſtedfaſt righteouſneſs, ſo it will unalterably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you for any unrighteouſneſſe.</p>

1. This Covenant is a <hi>new compact and agreement betwixt God and man;</hi> There was another agreement before this; a Covenant of <hi>another nature,</hi> and <hi>upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">It is a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with man.</note> 
                     <hi>termes</hi> and conſiderations, and <hi>for another end:</hi> But man ſtood not to that agreement, he did voluntarily tranſgreſſe it, and thereby deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all the benefits promiſed in that Covenant, and fell under that death and curſe, which God had threatened for the breach and tranſgreſſion of it: Now the new Covenant is (as it were) a <hi>plank after that ſhip-wrack;</hi> It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Indenture for life: it is not the ſame agreement renewed, nor the former Leaſe or Bond renewed, but a new one, of another kind and nature, made with man in another condition and capacity, and upon another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>God (preſently) made a new Covenant, or agreement with fallen man, different from the former made with created righteous man. If he had not done ſo, <note place="margin">If it had not been ſo, All man-kind had been loſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All man-kind had been eternally loſt:</hi> Sinful man could never have been recovered, never have been reſtored to life, but by a Covenant of grace; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but grace can recover the loſt ſinner. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Every mouth muſt be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, for by the Law is the knowledge of ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord had loſt all the glory of his mercy,</hi> if he had left us to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <note place="margin">God had loſt all the glory of his mercy.</note> of the firſt Covenant. Indeed there his juſtice, and wrath, and ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been exceedingly magnified, but his mercy had not riſen and appeared at all unto us, had not God made this new Covenant with us, being become ſinners, and ſo fit objects of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>Now the intent of God was to exalt his mercy, and that man ſhould know the greatneſſe and exceeding riches of it; and therefore God was pleaſed to make a new treaty, this Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There had been no news of a Chriſt,</hi> nor thought of him elſe. As Chriſt <note place="margin">There had been no news of a Chriſt.</note> is never effectually given unto any, but unto the loſt; ſo he was never made known untill the fall of man. And remember it, That as Chriſt was not, ſo he could not be revealed in a Covenant of works, whil'ſt life was held by that tenure. Chriſt is not to be found there, where life is claimed by a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our own; he is only to be found in a Covenant of grace, which gives life unto ſinners upon the righteouſneſſe of another. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>But now the righteouſneſſe of God without the law is manifeſted.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Even the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal reaſons, why God made a new Agreement, another Covenant, a Covenant of grace with ſinful man; namely, becauſe he would not loſe all man-kind, nor leave them deſpairing; and, Becauſe he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his own mercy, and likewiſe give his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and lay upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Redemption and ſalvation of his people.</p>

                     <p>3. <hi>THis Covenant of grace,</hi> is ſuch a compact wherein <hi>God promiſeth, That</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to be our God, and that we ſhall be his people. It is a Covenant of promiſe.</note> 
                        <hi>he will be our God, and that we ſhall be his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are three things obſervable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That this Covenant is a Covenant of promiſe,</hi> altogether of promiſe; God therein promiſeth all that doth concern himſelf or us. There are many things in it which do concern himſelf, and many things which do concern us, and they are all of them under promiſe. <hi>The rewards</hi> (if I may ſo call them) <hi>on his part,</hi> of life, and mercy, and grace, and ſalvation, they are all promiſed; and <hi>the ſervices,</hi> qualities, duties, <hi>on our part,</hi> in reference unto him as our God, are alſo promiſed by him. What <hi>he will performe,</hi> and what <hi>we are to performe,</hi> although they be different things, yet in this Covenant both of them are promiſed; He promiſeth <hi>to love us,</hi> and he promiſeth that <hi>we ſhall love him;</hi> He promiſeth, <hi>that he will forgive our ſinnes;</hi> and he promiſeth, that <hi>we ſhall repent</hi> of our ſinnes; He promiſeth that <hi>he will help us;</hi> and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, that <hi>we ſhall walk in his Satutes;</hi> He promiſeth that <hi>he will ſave us;</hi> and he promiſeth that <hi>we ſhall believe to the ſaving of our ſouls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the other Covenant of works, there God promiſeth life, and man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth obedience; God was to perform his part, and man was to perform his part, and mans performance depended upon his own ſtrength: But in this Covenant, God promiſeth all, and he undertakes all; He undertakes to give all that he promiſeth, and promiſeth to give all that he requireth. <hi>I will give</hi>

glorious Being and Attributes: as thus conſidered he is yours, makes all over unto you really.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or, <hi>Perſonally,</hi> as <hi>a Father;</hi> He is <hi>your Father,</hi> John 20. 17. <hi>I am a Father to Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 31. 9. <hi>As the Sonne,</hi> as God manifeſted in the fleſh, he is <hi>your Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt gives himſelf to be yours. And <hi>as the holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſo alſo he is yours. Oh what a Covenant is this, wherein the covenanted have ſuch a propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. The eternal God is my God; The All-ſufficient God is my God; The holy Ghoſt is my God; The merciful God is my God; The omnipotent, loving, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God is my God; and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is my Father; and Jeſus Chriſt, God the Sonne is my God; and God the holy Ghoſt is mine. I have an intereſt in him and them, and I have a communion and fellowſhip with them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Engagement of himſelf,</hi> with all that he hath, and all that he can do. What <note place="margin">Engagement of himſelf.</note> a God can be or can do for your good; Thus farre doth God engage unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when he makes a Covenant with them to be their God; he makes over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all, by bond unto you: what I am, I am to you, and for you; and what I have or can do, it ſhall be for you. I am the holy God, I will be Holineſſe to you; I am the merciful God, I will be merciful to your tranſgreſſions; I am the gracious God, I will ſhew favour to you, and will freely love and bleſſe you; I am the All-ſufficient God, and I will be a Sunne and a Shield unto you; I am the Omnipotent God, I will up old you by the right hand of my power; I am All, and will be All in All unto you; I am God bleſſed for ever; and I will be Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to you; for my Covenant with you, is the engagement of my ſelf, and of all good unto you.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> I will be a God unto you, or I will be your God in a Covenant of Grace; it is as if he ſhould ſay, I will be a God unto you, as long as I am God; <note place="margin">Perpetuity.</note> I am God for ever; and I will be your God for ever. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 48. 14. I will love you and bleſſe you for ever. Did I not ſay aright, when I told you, that Gods engaging of himſelf to be our God in the Covenant, was the ſoul, the life, the ſumme of the Covenant? what can we have more, or deſire more? A God to be our God, a merciful, gracious, bleſſed, bleſſing God, to be our merciful, gracious, our bleſſed, our bleſſing God, and all this as long as he is God, for ever, and for ever.</p>
                     <p>3. In this Covenant he promiſeth, <hi>that we ſhall be his people,</hi> Jer. 31. 33. <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>They ſhall be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He promiſeth we ſhall be his people.</note> 
                        <hi>my people, and I will be their God.</hi> Zach. 13, 9. <hi>I will ſay It is my people, and they ſhall ſay The Lord is my God.</hi> This is the Covenant; This mutual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement on either ſide is it, <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people.</hi> This is a Marriage, I will be your Husband, and you ſhall be my wife: I take you to to be my Husband; and I take you to be my wife; This Reciprocal conſent, and this Reciprocal agreement, Thou ſhalt be mine, and I will be thine; <hi>Thou ſhalt be for me,</hi> and <hi>I will be for thee,</hi> Hoſ. 3. 3. this makes the marriage: So the Reciprocal acceptance, conſent, and agreement betwixt God and us makes up the Covenant between us, in the very formal and vital nature of it.</p>

It was much that the great God ſhould make a Covenant with man in the ſtate of innocency; it is much more that he ſhould renew a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him in the ſtate of enmity: for the righteous God to covenant with righteous man, is not ſo wonderful, as for the holy God to make a Covenant with unholy man: To be a friend unto a friend is much leſſe than to be a friend unto an enemy: To ſhew favour to one who never deſerved wrath, is inferiour to this, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew the greateſt kindneſſe to one who deſerves the greateſt wrath, and utter rejection.

                     <p>There are four acts which God doth expreſſe when he becomes our God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is <hi>his chooſing act;</hi> he makes choyce of us before any other to be his people. <hi>The Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a ſpecial people unto himſelf, above all the people that are upon the face of the earth,</hi> Deut. 7. 6.</p>

                        <note place="margin">We chooſe him.</note> Deut. 26. 27. As the wife owns the husband, this is the man on whom her heart is ſet, and none but him.</p>

But are you ſure that you have not choſen ſome other Object with him, or before him? only the Lord God is choſen by you, and ſet up by you. No ſinful object, and no earthly object is ſet up: And are you ſo become his, as that you will be his for ever? you are bound to him, you cleave unto him; nothing ſhall part you and your God; no outward preferments, afflictions, and croſſes: do you count it your only happineſs to enjoy him, and your only unhappineſs to be deprived of him? do you ſay, None but God, none but God? as the Martyr ſaid, <hi>None but Christ.</hi> But are you ſo his, that he is the greateſt deſire, and the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and the greatly beloved of your ſouls? <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?

                     <p>2.

All you who have God to be your God, and who are his people this day; Now tell me you who heare this Sermon, and perhaps think that God is your God, what are your enjoyments, your portions, your poſſeſſions; what Covenant-gift, or work is to be found in your ſouls; And what are the great things after which you ſo pant, and ſigh? Is it the favour of God, is it the mercy of God, is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing, and ſubduing grace? I have nothing untill I have theſe, and I cannot be ſatisfied untill I have theſe. O Lord, be my God; O Lord forgive iniquity, remember me graciouſly, love me freely, heal my ſoul, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>4. You may know that God is your God, and that you are his people by <hi>your</hi>

                        <hi>ſubordination, and by your conformity of your wills to Gods Will;</hi> Beloved, the Covenant betwixt God and us, takes in theſe two things.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Subordination.</hi> For it is an agreement betwixt a Superiour and an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; betwixt the great God who is the Lord of all, and poor miſerable man, who is inferiour to him, and is to ſubject himſelf to his God, as to his Lord and Soveraign, to be ruled by him, and guided by him.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Conformity of will;</hi> for it is a Covenant of love, in which both parties have as it were but one heart, and one mind, and one will between them; and ſo in this Covenant <hi>[if we have God for our God; and if we be his people]</hi> what God likes, that do we like; and what our God loves, that do we love; and what our God hates, that do we hate; and what our God wills, that do we will; and what God would have done, that would we have done. This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is an agreement, and mutual conſent in all things; It will not permit us to give limits to God, becauſe he is our ſoveraign Lord; Nor will it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit contrarieties and contradictions 'twixt God and us; And therefore in this Covenant, <hi>God writes his law in our hearts;</hi> i. e. he puts into our hearts ſuch ſpiritual principles, as makes our will delightfully conformable unto his Will.</p>
                     <p>Alas! if there be an oppoſition 'twixt our hearts and God, a contradiction in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55323:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our minds and wills unto his mind and Will, this enmity plainly teſtifies, that he is not our God, and that we are none of his people; if you be at that point, that your judgement, and your will, and your luſts ſhall rule, and ſway, and govern, and command, and that God muſt ſtoop and yield to your thoughts, and to your pleaſures, and to your wills, &amp;c. But by this it appears that he is your God, and that you are his people, if God doth rule, and you do obey; if he commands, and you do hearken; if his mind rules your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if his Will rules your will, if his love rules your love, if his Law rules your lives; O Lord, what thou loveſt I love, what thou commandeſt I approve; good is the Word of the Lord, the Commandment is holy and juſt, and good.</p>
                     <p>5. You may know whether God be your God in Covenant, by <hi>the ſweet</hi>

                        <hi>contentment, and ſatisfaction, in the manifeſtations of your God in any part or branch of his Covenant into your ſouls.</hi> If the Lord at any time be pleaſed to anſwer the deſires of your ſouls in Covenant-love, or in Covenant-mercy, or in Covenant-grace, or in Covenant-ſtrength, or in Covenant-peace; O what a heavenly ſatisfaction is this! But a glimpſe of the favour of your God; but a taſte of the mercy of your God; never ſo little of grace or peace which is an Ambaſſage, a Letter, a Token from God, that he is your God; this is ſuch a life to you, it is ſuch a rejoycing, it is ſuch a cordial, it is ſuch a ſweet day to your ſoules; It is a thouſand times more than to hear news, that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of earthly preferments is yours, or that the largeſt of earthly poſſeſſions are yours; Covenant-manifeſtations are moſt precious unto all who are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 3. <hi>Say unto my ſoul, thou art my ſalvation.</hi>

You will go to him and none elſe; to your al-ſufficient God, to your Sunne, and to your ſhield; Remember thy Covenant, O my God, which thou haſt made, and ſave me, &amp;c. You may know that God is your God, by your care, and your carriage in walking with him, and before him, according to the Covenant; <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> Gen. 17. 1.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Chiefneſſe of good;</hi> Mans happineſſe muſt be the beſt of good. No good [below man] can be the happineſſe of man; and therefore mans happineſſe cannot be placed in the enjoyment of any created thing whatſoever, (ſuppoſe it be any gracious qualities) becauſe there is a good better than all theſe, and that is God himſelf.</p>

which the ſoul of man doth or can need and deſire, and is capable of; if the good be too ſhort, and failing, that it is not ſutable, or it is not extenſive, if it cannot fully reach unto, and fill up the ſoul; it is not bleſſedneſſe, for bleſſedneſſe is perfect; it cannot conſiſt with want; now ſuch a good God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is.</p>

But <hi>God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and <hi>he is the chiefeſt perfection;</hi> not only as to himſelf, but alſo as to us; that he is perfection to himſelf, is evident by his own al-ſufficiency, and by his own infiniteneſſe (al-ſufficiency is perfection, and infiniteneſſe is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and independency on any, is a perfection of, and no it, ſelf) and that he is a perfection, and the chiefeſt of perfection unto us is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for,</p>

There is no more to be deſired or enjoyed; for bleſſedneſſe is a compleat and fixed ſatisfaction to the ſoul; it fills up all wants, and all deſires, and therefore it gives reſt and quiet; and ſo doth God; The Rabbins ſay, that all the letters in the Name Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, are <hi>litterae quieſcentes,</hi> letters of reſt. <note place="margin">Bleſſedneſs is that good which is moſt deſirable.</note>
                     </p>

                     <p>2. What that is in and from God which makes up our bleſſedneſs, or a bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">What that is, in and from God, which is a bleſſedneſs unto us. Propriety.</note> unto us.</p>
                     <p>There are four things which do it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Propriety.</hi> Though God be an infinite bleſſedneſs in and to himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have any intereſt and propriety in him or not, yet he is not our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs without propriety; he muſt be our God, if he be our bleſſedneſs. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in bleſſedneſs, is our bleſſedneſs. He is rich who hath riches, and he is great who hath greatneſs; the ſeeing of lands, makes no eſtate unto us, but the poſſeſſion of them, and propriety in them, this doth it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Conformity;</hi> as our unhappineſſe conſiſts in diſſimilitude (the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">Conformity.</note> any man is to God, the more unhappy is that man) where nothing of God appears, there nothing of happineſſe appears, (for there can be nothing but darkneſſe, where there is nothing of light.) So on the contrary, our happineſſe depends upon ſimilitude with God; The more like we are to him, the more bleſſed are we. The Apoſtle delivers this as our very bleſſedneſſe, <hi>that when he appears we ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. Hence it is, that holy perſons are ſtiled bleſſed perſons: <hi>Bleſsed are the pure in heart,</hi> Matth. 5. 8. and holineſſe is happineſſe. Imperfect holineſſe, is imperfect happineſſe; and perfect holineſſe is perfect happineſſe. The more holy you are, the more like to God you are; and the more like you are to him, the more bleſſed you are. The more you partake of the Divine Nature, (which is the only bleſſed Nature) the more do you partake of bleſſedneſſe, for God is now the more yours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> As diſſimilitude with God, hinders God from being our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <note place="margin">Union.</note> ſo likewiſe doth diſtance from God; this muſt neceſſarily be ſo; for if God be bleſſedneſs, then a diſtance from God, is likewiſe a diſtance from bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs; of neceſſity there muſt be a nearneſs; yea, ſuch a nearneſs as makes a union, which muſt make up a bleſſedneſſe unto us; and indeed here lies our bleſſedneſs, that God unites himſelf unto us, and we are united to him.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Communion.</hi> This Communion of God with us, is our great happineſs on earth, and ſhall be our everlaſting happineſs in heaven, and it doth conſiſt <note place="margin">Communion.</note> in Gods gracious opening and manifeſting of himſelf unto the ſoul; not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in his loving of us, but eſpecially in the manifeſting that love unto us; not ſimply in his delight, but eſpecially in manifeſting that delight of his in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and in the imparting of his goodneſs to us; and verily in this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth our bleſſedneſs conſiſt; namely, that God doth manifeſt himſelf in love, and grace, and glory to us.</p>

                        <hi>one of theſe things which makes up bleſsedneſs;</hi> This ſo clear, that I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon it.</p>

                     <p>Mercifulneſs or mercy, doth eſpecially denote two things in God.</p>
                     <p>1. One is <hi>tender compaſſion;</hi> and therefore the mercies of God are frequently <note place="margin">Mercy denotes in God, Tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</note> ſtiled his bowels; <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies)</hi> or thy bowels of mercies. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 1. <hi>According to the multitude of thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of mercies;</hi> and ſo in the New Teſtament, <hi>Through the bowels of the mercy of our God,</hi> Luke 1. 78. It is remarkable, that the ſame word in the Hebrew, Chalde, Syriack, and Arabick, which ſignifies bowels, is uſed for mercy: which notes two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the mercies of God to his, are <hi>moſt inward, tender, affectionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions,</hi> like the bowels of a father, and of a mother to his deareſt children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in miſery.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That not only the <hi>effects of mercy,</hi> are the portion of Gods people, but the <hi>very heart of God acts towards them,</hi> and yearns over them: when he ſhews mercy to them, mercy comes from his very heart and bowels.</p>
                     <p>2. Another is, <hi>forgiveneſs of ſinnes;</hi> that eſſential propenſion in God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſinne, to paſs by tranſgreſſion, to blot out iniquity, and never to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">Forgiveneſſe of ſins.</note> ſinne any more. This is the Attribute of God, which is his great glory, and his great delight, and our only hope and life. There is a depth in this mercy, more than that in the Sea, and a height in this mercy, above all the thoughts of men; and a bredth in this mercy; it can pardon many ſins, great ſinnes, abundant ſinnes; and a length in this mercy; it is everlaſting, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever: This is the mercy, or mercifulneſs of God! And to enjoy God in this Attribute (as our merciful God, as pitying, as pardoning us, as forgiving and forgetting all our ſins, and never remembring them any more) O what a comfort, what a ſettling, what a joy, and a reſt is this!</p>
                     <p>Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>great care, and the great deſire almoſt of every man,</hi> eſpecially in diſtreſſes of conſcience, and times of ſickneſs and death; <hi>Be merciful unto me, O Lord, Lord be merciful unto me a ſinner.</hi> O that my ſinnes were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and how ſhall I get my ſinnes pardoned! He that doth not regard the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth yet prize and eſteem very much the merciful God. Every ſinner doth like and long for mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>All Controverſie is at an end, when mercy pardons ſinne.</hi> Now enmity is ſlain, and wrath and curſe go off (for theſe follow ſinne as unpardoned) but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55323:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if ſin be pardoned, all puniſhment is pardoned, and God is reconciled, and your ſouls are graciouſly accepted, and claſped with love and favour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When <hi>mercy pardons ſinne, then conſcience is at reſt; The broken bones are at eaſe and rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 51. (True peace follows full remiſſion of ſinnes) and then joy comes into the heart <hi>(Be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now though the Lord doth a while delay you, though he doth not preſently give you what you ask, though he takes a time before he ſpeak, though he doth not take your time, yet becauſe he is a <hi>faithful God,</hi> therefore he will take a time; and becauſe he is a <hi>wiſe God,</hi> therefore he will take the beſt time: He will anſwer you, he will help you, he will ſuccour you <hi>in an acceptable time,</hi> in the right ſeaſon which is the beſt part of time. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>He ſaith I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee.</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are ſix choice comforts from this unto you who have the Omnipotent God to be your God.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>You may caſt all your care upon him,</hi> whatſoever your wants be, (for ſoul or <note place="margin">You may caſt all your care upon him.</note> body) be they never ſo many, and never ſo great, and never ſo often, your God who is Omnipotent is able to ſupply them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think:</hi> you ask many things, and you think of many things, and you need many things, and your God is able to ſupply you in all theſe; able, yea abundantly able, abundantly able, yea, exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or think; his power exceeds all your wants: There are ſome wants that your friends can help you in, you may go to ſuch a friend and ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Lend me ſo much money to pay a debt, and he is able to help you, and yet there are ſome wants that no friend nor man can be a help unto you in them. When the famine was very grievous in <hi>Samaria,</hi> a <hi>woman</hi> cryed to the <hi>King of Iſrael, Help my Lord O King;</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> out of <hi>the barne-floor, or out of the wine-preſſe?</hi> 2 Kings 6. 26, 27. As if he had ſaid, In this thy ſtrait, I am not able to help thee. Beloved, our wants may quickly riſe above the power of man; but they can never riſe above the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God; every ſpiritual want exceeds the power of all creatures, but no corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or ſpiritual want exceeds the power of God; you need knowledge, your God is able to give it; and you need wiſdome, your God is able to give it; and you need mercy and grace, and comfort, and ſtrength, and deliverance, and faith, patience, love, meekneſſe, joy, peace, and friends, and bread, and houſe, &amp;c. God (your God) is able to ſupply every want that is preſent, or that is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We read of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that being in bondage they wanted liberty, and God gave it them; and being near the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> they wanted ſalvation, and God gave it; and <hi>being in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> they wanted water, the <hi>Rock</hi> is ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and water is given; and they wanted bread, and <hi>God rained down Manna;</hi> and they wanted fleſh, and God ſent them Quailes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If any man had ſuch a friend who had power enough for all ſorts of ſupplies, let his wants and ſtraits be what they may be, yet he were able to help all. O ſaith he, I am well, I have a friend who can help me in all my wants and ſtraits; Such a friend (amongſt men) cannot I confeſſe be found; but ſuch a God may be found, who can perform all things for you, who hath power enough to help againſt all temptations, and againſt all corruptions, and in all afflictions, and in all neceſſities, yea, and in all extremities.</p>

Omnipotency is (of it ſelf) ſufficient for all your helps and ſupplies; as it <hi>can do all things,</hi> ſo it can do all things <hi>from it ſelf:</hi> No creature is alone able or ſufficient to be an help unto you without God, but God alone is able to help you without any creature; for he is omnipotent. Suppoſe you be in danger, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to deliver you; ſuppoſe you be under trouble of Spirit, God alone is able to comfort you; ſuppoſe you need mercy, God alone is able to pardon you; ſuppoſe you be under outward wants, God alone is able to ſupply you; Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency needs the help of none; unto your help, it can <hi>create ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand loving kindneſſes,</hi> and <hi>deliverances,</hi> and any good.</p>

                     <p>There are three things concerning God which do aſſure you of the performance of his promiſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>His Will;</hi> the will of his goodneſs is in the making of all his promiſes; and the will of his reſolution is for the performing of them: <hi>Thou wilt performe the truth to Jacob, and the oath to Abraham,</hi> Micah 7. 20.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>His unchangeableneſſe</hi> or unfaithfulneſs: <hi>I will not ſuffer my faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to faile,</hi> Pſal. 89. 33. <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips,</hi> Verſe 34. <hi>He is faithful that promiſed,</hi> Heb. 10. 23.</p>

And ſo likewiſe for your joy and peace which are but weak, your God is able to fill you with joy in believing, to make your joy unſpeakable and full of glory; he is able to give you peace that paſſeth underſtanding, and to make it as a River. And ſo for <hi>temptations</hi> which do ſo much diſtreſs you, your God is not only able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Satan, but alſo to bruiſe him under your feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. It is a certain truth that Omnipotency hath no bounds or limits; you cannot ſay that God who works thus farre, can work no farther; as he can work all things unto their being, ſo he can work them up to that perfection of being of which they are capable.</p>

As if he ſhould ſay, many aſſay to hinder them and deceive of that life, but they are not able, they are in my Fathers hand, (in the keeping of his power) and he is greater (he is ſtronger) than all, put them all together, he is too ſtrong for them. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> There is not power enough in our ſelves to keep out ſelves, but there is power enough in God; and we are kept by the power of God (even unto ſalvation) untill we come to the heavenly glory.</p>

                     <p>There are four things which are apt to diſcourage our hearts, when we think of drawing near to God.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. One is the greatneſſe of our ſins.</item>
                        <item>2. A ſecond, is the greatneſſe of Gods mercies we need.</item>
                        <item>3. A third is the greatneſſe of our unworthineſſe.</item>
                        <item>4. A fourth is the greatneſſe of our evil deſerts.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>My ſinnes are ſo great, that I cannot expect that God will ever do me good: The mercies and bleſſings that I need, are ſo great, and I can lay down no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them. And I am unworthy of the leaſt of mercies; nay, I deſerve to be rejected and curſed! But now the graciouſneſſe of God is able effectually to remove all theſe diſcouragements.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Your ſinnes are great,</hi> and therefore you are afraid that the merciful God will not pardon them: But then remember, that the <hi>merciful God is a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſins.</note> 
                        <hi>God:</hi> As he hath riches of mercy, ſo he hath <hi>riches of grace:</hi> And as he promiſeth to forgive the ſinnes of his people, ſo he promiſeth to forgive their ſinnes <hi>freely (the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes according to the riches of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1. 7.) And this remember withal, that the gracious God forgives the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinnes, as well as the leaſt ſinnes of his people upon the ſame terms of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe. In <hi>Luke</hi> 7. we read of a <hi>leſſe debtor</hi> who owed <hi>fiftie pence;</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55323:25"/>
of <hi>a greater debtor,</hi> who owed <hi>five hundered pence, ver.</hi> 41. and the Creditor freely forgave them both, <hi>verſe</hi> 42. ſo, &amp;c. Your God hath not one way to forgive leſſe ſinnes, and another way to forgive greater ſinnes; but though the ſinnes be different, yet the terms or reaſons of forgiveneſs is one and the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the free grace of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. O but the <hi>mercies and bleſſings which I need, are ſo high and ſo great,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mercies that we need.</note> ſurely thoſe cannot come off but upon hard terms, and I have nothing to lay down for them.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, your God is a gracious God; Your God in his Covenant, hath <hi>promiſed all ſorts of good unto you;</hi> corporal, and ſpiritual; ſmall and great; And remember it for ever, that all the bonds of Gods Covenant are paid in upon the ſame rate: <hi>Grace</hi> was the reaſon of making all the promiſes, and <hi>Grace</hi> is the reaſon of the performance of every good: you ſhall have the greateſt good upon the ſelf-ſame termes as you have the leaſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. O but I am <hi>ſo unworthy of theſe mercies!</hi> What am I, and what is there in <note place="margin">Not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</note> me for God to look on, to affect and to move God to do ſuch great things for my ſoul!</p>
                     <p>Why! there is nothing in you, but an extreme need of theſe great good things promiſed by God, and an abſolute unworthineſſe of them: O but your God is a gracious God; and as an unworthy ſinner may go to a gracious God, ſo a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God will give all that he hath promiſed to his people, though they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Graciouſneſs findes the price of all mercies in it ſelf, it is the only reaſon of our enjoyments.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But I <hi>deſerve to be rejected in my ſuits,</hi> and <hi>to be ourſed.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil deſerts.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, and ſo you ſhould finde it, if God dealt with you according to your deſervings; but your God is a gracious God, and deales with his people, not in a rigorous way, but in a gracious way, of loving kindneſſe and mercies.</p>
                     <p>2. Is the gracious God your God? <hi>then all your mercies are ſure:</hi> you ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly poſſeſſe them, and inherit them: The children of grace are the ſureſt <note place="margin">Then all your mercies are ſure</note> heires of mercy: <hi>It is of grace that the promiſe might be ſure,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. Beloved! If God had Covenanted with you to be your God upon a reſpect to your works, and not upon a ſole reſpect to his own graciouſneſſe; and if he had promiſed you mercies, and other bleſſings, upon a bargain for your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not upon a foundation in his own graciouſneſſe; neither could God be ſure to you, nor could the mercies of God be ſure to you. <hi>Adam</hi> had as much (in a way of works) to have perpetuated, and enſured, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God and mercies upon himſelf, and more than ever we ſhall have, and yet all became unſure unto him; much more would it be with us, if God and we ſhould traffique that way; If God ſhould ſay to any of us, I promiſe to be your God, and to give you all bleſſings, upon condition of your perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obedience; your never failing obeying of my will, ſhall be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reaſon of your certain enjoyment of me! I dare averre it, that our enjoyment of God, and the good things by him promiſed would not be certain, or ſure unto us not one day, not one houre, nay, hardly one minute. But there comes the certainty of enjoying of God, and of his promiſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>viz.</hi> the grace or the graciouſneſs of God, I am freely yours, I will love you freely, I will bleſs you freely for mine own ſake, though not for your ſake.</p>
                     <p>Our obedience is a weak and unſtedfaſt reaſon, but Gods grace is a full and conſtant reaſon for all our mercies, and for all our pleas, and for all our enjoyments. <note place="margin">Then you have plea enough to deal with God.

                     <p>Again, which way Chriſt goes, that way the promiſes go; Now Chriſt belongs to every believer; therefore the promiſes alſo belong &amp;c.</p>

They are <hi>ſuſceptions of grace;</hi> whatſoever promiſe God makes to you, <note place="margin">They are ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of grace.</note> grace is the foundation of it, and grace is in the performance of it. It is freely made, and as freely made good; nothing moved God to make the promiſes, but his own grace; and there is no reaſon why we enjoy the good of them, but Gods own grace, I will do you good, and all this good I will do for my own ſake; you ſhall have it as freely as ever child had kindneſſe from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>paternal anger</hi> or wrath; from this they are not free; <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer,</hi> Iſa. 54. 8.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>judicial anger</hi> or wrath, which conſiſts in two things. 1. In a <hi>reſolution, by no means to cleare the wicked,</hi> to acquit, to paſſe by offences, to be pacified. 2. In a <hi>pouring forth the vials of his juſt vengeance upon tranſgreſſors,</hi> according to the demerits of their ſinnes and wickedneſſes; <hi>There is a cup in the hand of the Lord, and the wine is red, it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the ſame, but the dreggs thereof, all the wicked of the earth ſhall wring them out, and drink them,</hi> Pſal. 75. 8.

                     </p>

                     <p>Now this our immunity is a ſingular comfort unto us. It is a great matter to be delivered from the wrath of man; what is it then to be freed from the wrath of God!

                     <p>But you who are the people of his Covenant, as you ſhall never fall under the power of that future wrath of God, ſo you ſhall never taſte one drop of Gods judicial revenging wrath any one moment of your preſent life; whatſoever your troubles, and croſſes, and ſadneſſes may be, yet there is no judicial wrath in them; Chriſt hath fully drunk off the cup for you, and ſatisfied the juſtice of God, who by his blood is reconciled and well-pleaſed with you.</p>

                     <p>But from the effectual redundancy of this damnation upon your perſons, you are every one freed who are in Covenant with God; <hi>For there is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. And <hi>whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> John 3. 15. And the ground of this your immunity from the damnation due unto you for your ſinnes, is the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath made for your ſinnes unto the juſtice of God; and thereupon the obtaining of riches of mercy from your God, who (according to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you) blots out, and forgives all your ſinnes, and never remembers them any more.</p>
                     <p>For this is a ſure truth, that remiſſion of ſinnes, and actual damnation for ſinnes, are incompatible, or inconſiſtent. Now whether this be any cauſe of comfort that you and your ſinnes are parted, and that you and hell are for ever ſeparated, I leave it to any one of you to judge: for mine own part, I do look upon four things as very great mercies. 1. That I am delivered from the power of ſinne. 2. That I enjoy the pardon of ſinne. 3. That I ſhall never be damned for ſinne. 4. That I ſhall be ſaved, notwithſtanding all my ſinnes.</p>

They have immunity or freedome <hi>from juſtification by the Law,</hi> from all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <note place="margin">From juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Law.</note> tryals for life: Although you are not freed from the Law as it is a rule for life, yet you are freed from the Law as it is a Covenant of life; although you are not freed from the Law as it is the image of the good and holy will of God, yet becauſe you are under the Covenant of grace, you are freed from the Law as it is a reaſon of ſalvation and juſtification. The Covenant of grace takes you off from that Court and that Bar which pronounceth life upon your own good works; and pronounceth death upon your own evil works; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> Gal. 3. 11. <hi>No man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law in the ſight of God, for the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> As the Law calls for perfect and perſonal righteouſneſſe of our own; ſo the Law will not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie you, it will not give life unto you, unleſſe it finds that righteouſneſſe in you; you live not, if you be not perfectly righteous; abſolution is pronounced upon your own perfect innocency, and condemnation is pronounced upon any defect or breach: And verily upon this account, no man living can or ſhall be juſtified; therefore here is comfort, that being in Chriſt, and in this Covenant of grace, ye are <hi>juſtified from all things from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes;</hi> See the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. Your life doth not lie now in your own righteouſneſſe, but in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; nor doth it depend upon your own works, but upon the obedience of Chriſt.

Chriſt hath dyed and ſatisfied for your ſinnes, and he was made a curſe for you, and there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt. Sometimes you fear becauſe of the powerful motions and conflicts, and rebellions of ſinne in your hearts: but why do you ſo? ſeeing that ſinne ſhall not have dominion over you, and Chriſt in you is daily mortifying and deſtroying the body of ſinne; neither ſhall any Lord reigne in you, but your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour who dyed for you.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes you fear becauſe of the imperfection of your graces; but why do you ſo? It is not your weakneſſe or want of holineſſe, but Chriſts perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is imputed unto you for life, and for juſtification.</p>

                     <p>Sometimes you fear men becauſe of their malice and power; and why do you ſo? your God will reſtrain the rage of man, and fruſtrate the counſels of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and break the armes of the ungodly, and knows how to deliver you.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes you fear to dye; but why are you afraid of death? which is but the laſt Stile to go over, and then you are at your Fathers houſe; death to you is but an end of your ſinnes and miſeries, and only a quick paſſage into your eternal happineſſe.</p>

For <hi>their ſecurity,</hi> to ſecure them againſt all danger and evil: and this you finde (in verſe 18.) <hi>I will make a Covenant for them with the beaſts of the field; &amp;c.</hi> No creature ſhall do them hurt, neither the beaſts of the field, nor fowles of the aire, nor the creeping things of the earth, nor no wicked enemies who bend the bow, and draw the ſword, and prepare to the bottle; As when a Covenant is between Nation and Nation, all the people are thereby bound up from all acts of hoſtility and miſchief; ſo the Lord by making a Covenant with the beaſts and fowls, &amp;c. he doth therein binde them up from being prejudicial to his people.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond is for <hi>their proſperity:</hi> and this you may finde (in verſe 21. 22.) <hi>I will hear the heavent, and the heavens ſhall hear the earth, and the earth ſhall hear the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The heavens do (as it were) beg of God that they may ſend down ſeaſonable ſhowers, and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able influences; and the earth doth (as it were) beg of God, that it may be made fruitful by thoſe influences of heaven, &amp;c. And God doth promiſe to hear every one of them for <hi>Jezreel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. All the creatures are in the hand of the Father; and as all creatures are <note place="margin">All creatures are in a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the will of your God.</note> brought into the bond of the Covenant for you, ſo <hi>all the creatures of the world are in a ſubordination, and a neceſſary ſubmiſſion unto the will and pleaſure of your God.</hi> If he ſaith to any of them Go, it goeth, or to any of them Come, and it cometh; your God hath an over-ruling Providence over them: all their power, and operations, and motions are at the ſole will and command of him; they act as God will have them act, and when God will have them act, and for them for whom God will have them to act; and ſhall not all this be for you for your good who are the people of his Covenant, and the children of his love?</p>

                        </gap>eady to do you any good. There are four things which (if you did ſeriouſly conſider of them) would be of ſpecial help unto you, againſt your fears, and would ſtreng then your hearts in all your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Gods relation unto you,</hi> as your God, <hi>is a relation of the deareſt love,</hi> and kindneſſe, and grace, and mercy, and peace, and bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>Gods Covenanting with you</hi> to be a God unto you, it <hi>is the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement which God can lay upon himſelf,</hi> and the fulleſt aſſurance which he can give unto you, that he will be your God.

Then <hi>the people of God ſhould encourage themſelves in the Lord their God,</hi> and make up themſelves in their Covenant intereſt againſt all the diſcouragements which they meet with in the world. There are the Creature intereſts, and there are the Covenant intereſts; you are many times deprived of the former. The world loves his own, and the world hates you, and deals hardly and deceitfully with you. The world ſlights, and contemns, and reproaches, and withdraws, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55323:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and troubles you, and perſecutes you! Now in ſuch caſes you ſhould not ſuffer diſcouragements to ſink and tear your hearts: you ſhould remember</p>
                     <p>1. That you <hi>are not of the world,</hi> but are choſen out of the world.</p>
                     <p>2. That you have <hi>a Covenant intereſt</hi> (God is your God in Covenant) and by vertue of that Covenant intereſt, you ſhall find that in your God, which is denyed you in the world: As the Church ſpake, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtleſſe, thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael acknowledget us not. Thou, O Lord art our Father, our Redeemer, &amp;c.</hi> You ſhall finde it better in your God, then it can ever be found in the world: You cannot find love, and kindneſs, and favour, and good dealing, and faithfulneſs, and help from the world; O but you ſhall find at that time love, and kindneſs, and favour, and tender dealing, and faithfulneſſe, and help from your God. Though men will not love you, yet your God will love you; though men will curſe you, yet God will bleſſe you; though men forſake you, yet your God will help you; Yea and you ſhall find the love of your God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and his countenance, and his preſence, and his gooneſs a thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more ſweet, and refreſhing, and comforting, then all the comforts could be to you, which are denied unto you by the weake Creature.</p>
                     <p>O Chriſtians! Be not ſo dijected upon Creature with-drawments, and upon Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture failings, or upon Creature oppoſitions: there is enough in your God, and there is better in your God; There is fulneſs in him, and a living fulneſſe: you have all, and abound by enjoying God to be your God. Though you have not the Candle, yet you have the Sun: though not the dirty puddles, yet you have ſtreams and fountains. Reckon the enjoyment of God for your God, reckon this as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reckon on it as your beſt and fulleſt good. Aſſuredly it is enough to make up your happineſſe, and that which is enough to make you happy. It is enough to countervaile all other things which can never make you happy.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Give diligence to make out unto your ſoules this Covenant relation twixt God</hi>

                        <hi>and you;</hi> as you have a real intereſt in God, ſo reſt not untill you do attaine unto a perſonal evidence that God is your God, and that you are his people: untill you can ſay as the Church in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 8. <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father.</hi> verſe 9. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſee we beſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things I would briefly ſpeak concerning this duty.</p>
                     <p>1. You <hi>may attain unto this perſonal evidence,</hi> and <hi>certainty of knowledge;</hi> That <note place="margin">You may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal evidence.</note> God is your God, and that you are his people for aſmuch as</p>
                     <p>1. You <hi>have expreeſſe promiſes for this</hi> in Zach. 13. 9. They ſhall call upon my Name, and I will hear them, <hi>I will ſay It is my people,</hi> and they ſhall ſay, <hi>The Lord is my God.</hi> So Ezek. 34. 30. <hi>Thus ſhall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, even the houſe of Iſrael are my peaple, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Both <hi>the graces of the Spirit, and the teſtimony of the Spirit can make the Covenant relation evident unto you.</hi> The graces in you are the infallible characters that God is indeed your God, and that you are indeed his people. The Spirit of grace is given only unto the people of God, and unto every one of the people of God; and beſides that you have the <hi>testimony of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Yea have received the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry Abba Gather.</hi> Verſe 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>2. You <hi>ſhould strive to attain unto this perſonal evidence of your relation:</hi> Next to your being in the Covenant, I do not know any one thing of that advantage unto you, as the knowledge (upon ſure grounds) that God is your God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p>It is of ſingular advantage and benefit unto you.</p>
                     <p>1. For the <hi>ſetling of the heart.</hi> If this Covenant relation were known of you, you may ſay as <hi>David, Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoule,</hi> Pſal. 116. 7. Your ſouls can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſetled by knowing what is happineſs, but by knowing your propriety in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55323:48"/>
whiles your propriety is unſetled, all is unſetled within you; and if that be obtained, all is peace, and at peace; I know that this God is my God.</p>
                     <p>2. For the <hi>Comfort and joy of your hearts:</hi> It is fruition joyned with knowledge <note place="margin">For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your hearts.</note> which is the Spring of all delight and comfort: You have heard the precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which belong unto the people of God, who have God to be their God, and yet none of them have made comfort within your ſoules, becauſe you are doubtful whether God be your God: it is certain you cannot taſte the comforts, whiles you fear your title and intereſt: But if your intereſt were clear, your joy would be full: happineſſe known to be ours, is a neceſſary cauſe of joy. The Saints in glory have moſt joy, becauſe they have the fulleſt knowledge of the enjoyment of their happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>3. For <hi>your confidence in approaching unto God,</hi> and in the application of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">For your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God.</note> promiſes of God, your wayes to God would be alwaies open and faire; in all your duties, and in all the Ordinances you might ſay I am now going to my God and Father to help me: and that promiſe is my portion, and this promiſe is my hope; They are all of them mine, for God himſelf is mine: He hath given them (every one of them) unto me, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.) That I might not fear, that I might have ſtrong hope, and conſolation, and encouragement. I will ſay no more unto you, but this, the knowledge of your Covenant-relation unto God, it is the life of your lives, and the life of your prayers, and the life of your confidences, and the life of your hope, and the life of your comforts, it is your Paradiſe, and your Heaven here on earth.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Maintain and juſtifie your Covenant-relation</hi> (when once it is made manifeſt <note place="margin">Maintain and juſtifie your Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

For I am <hi>perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor powers, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> You are many times under Spiritual ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe, or any other trials of your ſelves, yet God ſtill maintains his intereſt in you, and your relation to himſelf. <hi>God hath not caſt away his people whom he foreknew,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> Mal. 3. 6. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>grace;</hi> The neceſſity and happineſſe whereof he hath heard ſo much.</p>
                     <p>The Directions which I would commend unto you for this, are theſe.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Go unto God, and beſeech him to be your God, and to make you to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Beg of God to be your God, and make you his people.</note> for none can make God to be a God in Covenant unto him, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and none can take God to be his God in Covenant, but from the ſtrength of God alone. Hence it is, that as to the firſt entrance into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we (for our parts) are rather paſſive than active; and are rather Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted than Covenanting; God muſt make us to be his, before we can come to be his; yea he muſt make us willing to be his, before we can be willing to be ſo; and therefore (if you have obſerved it) not only the making of a new Covenant is ſettled and raiſed by the gracious Will of God, but the bringing of us into that Covenant, doth totally depend upon the gracious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſure of the ſame God; <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people:</hi> As to bring in a ſinner unto Chriſt, it is not ſufficient that he is the <hi>effect of his purchaſe;</hi> but it is likewiſe required that he be the <hi>fruit of his conqueſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt muſt by his Spirit reſcue him out of the poſſeſſion of ſinne and Satan; So to bring a ſinner into Covenant with God, it is not enough that the ſinner lies within the intention of grace, but it is moreover requiſite, that God do put
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55323:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forth the mighty efficacy of his grace to ſubdue the heart and will of the ſinner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>For the carrying on of this Direction, I would lay down ſix Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there <hi>is not in any ſinner a ſelf-ſufficiency to cloſe with God in a way</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">There is not in any ſinner a ſelf-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to cloſe with God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> 
                        <hi>of Covenant;</hi> for as the Covenant of grace is a truth of meer ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation (no light of nature reveals it, or diſcovers it) ſo the bringing of the ſinner into this Covenant, is a meerly ſupernatural work. There is nothing in the ſinner actively to contribute towards it; nay, all that is in the ſinner, is naturally averſe and contrary unto it; his natural judgement doth reaſon againſt it, and contradict it; and his natural will doth reſiſt and oppoſe it, unbelief being predominant in both; and therefore the work being only the work of a God, the ſinner hath no way to take but to go to God to work his own work in him, and for him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The heart of a ſinner, how ever it be naturally averſe to God, and to fall <note place="margin">The reſiſtance of the heart is conquerable by the power of God.</note> in with him, yet the <hi>diſobedience and reſiſtance of it, is conquerable and ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Almighty power of God,</hi> with whom nothing is impoſſible, and for whom nothing is too hard; He can quicken the dead, and give ſight to the blinde, and eares to the deaf, and deliver from the power of darkneſſe, and take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh; And as it is in his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to forme creatures into what kinde of being he pleaſeth, ſo it is in his power to make any creature yielding unto any part of his Will as he reſolveth: he can abaſe the pride of mans heart, and break the hardneſſe of mans heart, and heale the ſtoutneſſe and the ſtubbornneſſe of mans will, and turn it which way ſoever he pleaſeth, and faſhion it (by a Commanding Power) into the obedience of his own Will.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There <hi>is no ſinner</hi> (for ought that I know, living under the Goſpel) <hi>who</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">No ſinner li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under the Goſpel, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Covenant.</note> 
                        <hi>can infallibly determine it, that God hath peremptorily excepted againſt him,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely excluded him from the Covenant;</hi> (that is) That God will never be a God to him, nor will he ever make him to be one of his people: Although at the preſent a ſinner may certainly know that he is out of the Covenant, and he is none of his people; yet he doth not know that God will never be his God, and that he ſhall never be one of Gods people; becauſe, Firſt, God reveals no ſuch thing. Secondly, God doth reveal that ſome who are not his people, ſhall yet be his people. Thirdly, God ordinarily calls them to be his people who were not his people. Fourthly, The times and ſeaſons of that call are unknown to the children of men; even theſe ſeaſons alſo doth God reſerve unto himſelfe, and keep in his own hand and breaſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould pray to God to bring us into Covenant; for who doth know what his purpoſe of grace may be, and what his thoughts of mercy are towards him?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>ſinner, although he doth not know the ſecret intention of God, yet he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Though the ſinner know not the ſecret intention of God, yet he knows his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                        <hi>doth know the gracious invitation of God;</hi> to leave his ſinnes, and to believe in Chriſt, and to come into Covenant with him, and that he will ſhew mercy to him. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. I think that there is no ſinner living under the Goſpel, but he lives under an external call; the Covenant of grace is (in ſome meaſure) made known unto him, and the glorious riches of mercy and grace, and he receives many a ſummons to come into Chriſt, to believe, to accept of God to be his God, and to be one of his people; and alſo he knows upon what gracious termes God is contented to be his God: Now, becauſe God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in and by the Goſpel, not only to reveal the Covenant of grace unto ſinners, but alſo to treate indefinitely with ſinners, and to offer mercy, and life, and ſalvation unto them, if they will come

                     <p>2. If you would have God to be your God in Covenant, you muſt then <hi>break</hi>

                     <p>There are two Covenants which are inconſiſtent with this Covenant of grace. 1. One is the Covenant of good works. 2. The other is the Covenant with bad works; If one will ſet up his confidence on his own good works, he makes void the Covenant of grace; and if one will ſet his heart upon his ſinne, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will not leave my ſinnes, I love them, I will not forſake them; This man diſables himſelf, he doth debarre and exclude himſelf; God will not be his God, he will not make a Covenant with him; and indeed this ſinner will not make a Covenant with God.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which God ſtands upon if we will have him to be ours in Covenant.</p>

                        </gap> one of theſe will be, if you keep up a Covenant with ſinne: you will never be willing to be his, if you reſolve to keep your ſinnes; and you cannot love the Lord, if you love your ſinnes; neither can you ſerve him, if you will obey ſinne as your Lord; There is an abſolute incompatibility for this, both on Gods part, and on your part, and on the Covenants part.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>On Gods part;</hi> for he cannot nor will not make any agreement with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, nor hold communion with any who will hold communion with

darkneſſe; he is of purer eyes than to behold ſinne; much more than to agree with ſinne; it is contrary to his nature, it were diſhonourable for him ſo to do, to admit a competition with that which he ſo much threatens; and which his ſoul doth hate and abhorre.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>On our part;</hi> your hearts cannot be brought to hold up a Covenant with God, and yet to hold up a Covenant with your ſinnes; you cannot love God, and that which is contrary to God; you cannot love ſinne, and that which is contrary to ſinne at the ſame time; for if you love the Lord, you will hate ſinne; and if you love ſinne, you will hate the Lord.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>On the Covenants part;</hi> the Covenant of God is to change the ſinful heart, it is to ſubdue iniquity, it is to cleanſe us from all our uncleaneſſes, it is to make us an holy people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>O when a ſoul comes to be afflicted for ſinnes, and to acknowledge it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of mercies, this ſoul is in a right poſture for mercies.

                        <hi>faith;</hi> for God is a God in Covenant only with believers: and there are three degrees of faith neceſſary unto this work; one is a faith of acceptance; a ſecond <note place="margin">Three degrees of faith neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> is a faith of dependance; a third is a faith of reliance; I will explain my ſelf in all theſe.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>A faith of acceptance</hi> is neceſſary to put us into the Covenant, and to finde <note place="margin">A faith of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</note> God to be our God; that is, we muſt have ſo much faith as to accept of Chriſt, and to unite us unto Chriſt; for in that union twixt us and Chriſt, in this relation of God to us is he to be found; <hi>By him we have acceſſe unto the Father,</hi> Epheſ. 2. Out of Chriſt you ſhall never finde God to be reconciled unto you, nor to be your God: As <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> God firſt is a God in Covenant, and Father in Covenant; ſo <hi>to us,</hi> God becomes our God and our Father upon our being in Chriſt. Chriſt received the Covenant for himſelf, and for all who are his; he is as it were the head, and the principal in the Covenant; all his come into Covenant under him as in relation to him.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>A faith of dependance</hi> upon Chriſt particularly for his great ſatisfactions <note place="margin">A faith of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</note> unto God; that is, we muſt depend upon the blood of Chriſt, and by faith offer that up as a ſatisfaction for all our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions which have all this while kept God and us at diſtance and difference; his blood is the ſacrifice by which Gods juſtice is ſatisfied; and truly untill divine juſtice be ſatisfied for our ſinnes, there is no hope of a Covenant to be made 'twixt God and us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by faith look upon the blood of Chriſt, and offer up that blood by faith; Lord, here is the blood of the Covenant, here is the blood of Chriſt to ſatisfie for my ſinnes, and to expiate my ſinnes; now in this blood of his become my God in Covenant.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>A faith of reliance</hi> upon the mediation of Chriſt as the atonement and <note place="margin">A faith of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> peace, and reconciliation; Chriſt did <hi>make peace by his blood,</hi> and he did <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us by it,</hi> Coloſ. 1. 20, 21. And <hi>we who were ſometimes afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 13.</p>
                     <p>I know not a more exact way to get God to be our God, than by getting into Chriſt, in whom alone our re-union with God is to be found, and by whom alone God and we are knit together again; not without cauſe is he called the Mediator of the new Covenant, who undertakes between God and us, (as you ſhall hear ere long) he undertakes to take away all which may keep up the difference 'twixt us, and he undertakes to preſent all which may make a reconciliation betwixt us; he doth make the way ſo open, and ſo clear, that our entrance into Covenant will certainly follow, if once we were poſſeſſed of him by faith; his blood being ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and likewiſe to procure a reconciliation 'twixt God and us; and therefore above all things ſtrive for faith to unite you to Chriſt, and then by faith plead out the reconciliation purchaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Apply your ſelves unto the Ordinances of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which are the means to work all theſe things in you, and particularly this faith which is ſo neceſſary, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <note place="margin">Apply your ſelves to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt.</note> to our admiſſion into the Covenant. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom you alſo truſted after that you heard the Word of Truth, the Goſpel of your ſalvation;</hi> the Goſpel

is that Ordinance by which God makes known the Covenant of grace, and by which faith is wrought to bring us into Chriſt, and by him into Covenant with God, and by which our faith is ſo enlarged and confirmed, that at length we come to know that God is indeed our God in Covenant.</p>
                     <p>6. I will adde one direction more as an help to bring us into the Covenant, <note place="margin">Seriouſly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</note> and taking of God to be our God; and that is <hi>a ſerious meditation of God himſelf,</hi> and of <hi>the nature of this Covenant of grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. A ſerious meditation <hi>of God;</hi> there is nothing in him to diſcourage you <note place="margin">Of God.</note> from coming into Covenant with him; and there is all in him to encourage you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is <hi>nothing in him to diſcourage you from coming into Covenant with him:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him to diſcourage us.</note> He doth not in this Covenant treat with you for any perſonal ſatisfaction, for the wrong which you have done him, neither doth he inſiſt for any goodneſſe that you ſhould work in your own hearts, nor doth he except againſt you for any unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in you, nor doth he diſtinguiſh you away for the greatneſſe of your former tranſgreſſions, nor yet doth deny you hope and acceſſe, although you have a long time denied him audience unto his gracious offers, nor doth he capitulate with you in your own name, but by a Mediator, who is moſt pleaſing to him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is <hi>all in and from him to encourage you</hi> to come into Covenant <note place="margin">There is all in and from him to encourage you.</note> with him; for he doth expreſſe himſelf to be a <hi>merciful God</hi> towards ſinners; to be a <hi>gracious God</hi> to the ſinners that come to him, to be a <hi>tender God</hi> eaſily moved at the tears and cryes of thoſe who would be his people; to be a willing God to accept of you, and to cloſe with you; and therefore he firſt makes known this Covenant, and he firſt offers to treat with you about this Covenant, and he makes the termes of agreement as fair as grace it ſelf can frame them; and he out of his own coſt provided and ſent Jeſus Chriſt to be both the Meſſenger of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Mediator of the Covenant; and beſides all this, he affords unto you the Goſpel to work faith in you, that ſo you may become the people of his Covenant; and moreover, he makes promiſes unto you of every thing which belongs to the making of a people to be the people of his Covenant; yea, and he promiſeth his own Spirit to them that ask him, by whoſe mighty operation we come indeed to be his people. Truly a ſerious meditation of all this, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to perſwade our hearts to come in unto him, and take him for our God in Covenant.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond meditation of the <hi>nature of this Covenant of grace,</hi> both as to the <note place="margin">Of the nature of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; both, As to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it.</note> compoſition of it, and to the happineſſe in and by it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This Covenant of grace <hi>is ſo modell'd and framed</hi> with as winning and alluring a way for ſinners, as poſſibly can be drawn out by the wiſdome of a kinde and good God. It is made with all advantages to the ſinner, ſo that if there be any looſing or damnifying, it falls rather to God than to the ſinner; all the expreſſions of it are upon the account of Gods grace. And it is made with ſuch tender reſpects to poor ſinners, that all the active part to make them to be the people of God is undertaken by God himſelf; he undertakes to make us to be his people, to give himſelf, to give Chriſt, to give his Spirit, to give a new heart, to give the Spirit of prayer, to give the Spirit of faith, to give pardoning mercy, to give all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O how might all this (if ſeriouſly and rightly meditated upon) melt in our hearts to God, and make us willing to take him for our God!</p>

But we know no merit but that of ſin which deſerves damnation; and the merit of Chriſt which deſerves ſalvation; All our ſtanding, and all our expectation it the grace of God, that is the reaſon of all our enjoyments; God doth not give us Chriſt becauſe we deſerve a Chriſt, but becauſe he is pleaſed freely to beſtow Chriſt upon us; God doth not forgive our ſins for our own ſake, but for his own Name ſake. God doth not love us for any thing in us, but he loves us freely, becauſe he is pleaſed to love us; God doth not ſave us for any works of ours, but he ſaves us for his mercies ſake; God doth not bleſſe us for our goodneſſe ſake, but he bleſſeth us only for his Chriſts ſake, and his promiſes ſake: God doth not juſtifie us for the ſake of our own righteouſneſſe, but he juſtifies us free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his own grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 3. 24.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Solution.</hi> I anſwer. 1. It was the freeneſſe of his grace to make all thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. 2. Though he bindes himſelf in promiſes to do us good, yet he doth not accompliſh thoſe promiſes upon the reaſon of our goodneſſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, but upon the account of his own mercifulneſſe, and goodneſſe, and graciouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But he promiſeth many things conditionally, and lets them out upon ſuch and ſuch conditions, and herefore not freely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Every kind of condition is not oppoſite to grace, as I ſhall ſhortly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate unto you.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whatſoever condition he makes with his people for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any good, he doth freely give, and work that condition in them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. No condition on our part hath any reaſon of merit in it, which is the thing oppoſite to grace, but it is only a means by which we come certainly to enjoy that which God is pleaſed graciouſly to give; In this reſpect we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith, and to be ſaved by faith, and yet we are alſo juſtified by grace, and ſaved by grace; Faith you ſee is put in as a condition, and yet it excludes not grace; Nay, becauſe by faith, therefore by grace; for our faith and Gods grace can well agree, though Gods grace and mans deſerts can never agree.</p>

If the Lord ſhould ſay unto us, Here is the ſweeteſt love that ever ſinner taſted of, but you muſt deſerve it; alas, then I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it.

As he ſaid <hi>Tolle meum &amp; tolle Deum,</hi> ſo ſay I, <hi>Tolle gratiam &amp; tolle omnia;</hi> take away grace, and take away all; then take away Chriſt, and take away God, and take away mercy, and take away heaven, and take away hope, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all; the ſinner is utterly loſt upon any account, but that of grace only; it is this graciouſneſſe which makes him capable, and makes him hopeful; here is a loving God, and he will love you freely; here is a merciful God, and he will pardon you freely; here is a converting God, and he will receive you gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly; here is a good God, and he will bleſſe you graciouſly, &amp;c. Now the ſinner begins to have hope, and begins to hearken; If there be a Covenant of grace, why ſhould I deſpaire? If it be altogether gracious, if it be raiſed by grace, and publiſhed by grace, and admits and receives by grace, and lets out all by grace, there is yet hope that I may eſcape periſhing, that I may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that I may find mercy and favour; grace looks for no worthineſſe, and grace paſſeth by all unworthineſſe, and grace may look on, and pity and help the greateſt of ſinners; bleſſed be God who hath ſweetened all his mercies, and all his undertakings, and all his bleſſings, and all his givings, with freeneſſe and graciouſneſſe.</p>

O beloved, yet be ſerious and wiſe, and make in to God! you may be received graciouſly; your ſins have been exceeding great, but the Covenant holds out more exceeding mercy joyned with more exceeding grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Where ſinne abounded, grace did much more abound;</hi> If you come in to God, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is to forgive all your ſins, and to forgive them freely.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Remember ſtill that you are in a Covenant of grace.</hi> The Covenant is not <note place="margin">That you are ſtill in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace</note> a Covenant of grace only, whiles you are brought in, but it is a Covenant of grace after that you are brought in unto it; you could finde nothing to reſt on before; nor muſt you finde any thing to reſt on but the grace of God, after that you are got into the Covenant of grace; you ſhall find wants ſtill, and weakneſſes ſtill, and unworthineſſe ſtill; but withal remember that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of grace ſtill; what's that? my meaning is, that God will ſtill deal with you in a gracious way, and you may go unto him ſtill upon his own gracious termes, and (as ſo) expect continual helps and ſupplies from him. <hi>Save me for thy mercies ſake,</hi> ſaid <hi>David.

                     <p>O how vainly and ſimply do we trouble and diſquiet our own ſouls, as if the gracious Covenant were ſometimes free, and ſometimes not free; that ſome of the things promiſed in the Covenant muſt drop out freely, and yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things muſt be pumped out by ſomething of our own; that the leſſer mercies are free, but the greater mercies muſt come off upon harder termes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that our coming into Covenant, this is all of grace; but our receipts from the Covenant, theſe are not ſo! truly theſe are many times our thoughts; but the Lord knows that the thoughts of man are vain, and theſe are ſo; for as we are found by grace, and made by grace, ſo we live, and are brought up by grace till we come to glory. And as our admiſſions into the Covenant are only gracious, ſo all our receptions are ſo, and muſt be ſo all our dayes, that God alone may have all the glory.</p>

                     <p>There are two things unto which I would briefly ſpeak concerning this property of the Covenant, namely the ſureneſſe or certainty of it.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How it may be demonſtrated, That the Covenant of grace is a ſure <note place="margin">How it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to be a ſure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.

                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>This Covenant depends upon the counſel of God, and the purpoſe of God,</hi> and <hi>love of God,</hi> immutable and ſure grounds; theſe are (as it were) the ſprings and the foundations of the Covenant of grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods love unto us, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel wiſely and deliberately contriving for us, and his purpoſe reſolving and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding everlaſting good unto us.</p>
                     <p>Now every one of theſe is ſure and certain; <hi>The love of God</hi> is unchangeable; <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>The purpoſe of God</hi> is ſure. So the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure;</hi> that foundation of God is his election, which is compared to a foundation, becauſe it is that upon which all our good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is built, and becauſe as a foundation it abides firme and ſure.</p>
                     <p>2. This Covenant hath <hi>as firme and ſure Ingredients as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It hath firm and ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in it,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The preſence of what is neceſſary to the certain performance of the Covenant.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The preſence of what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the performance of it; as,</note> There are two things neceſſary thereunto. 1. The power of God. 2. The Will of God; if God be able, and if God will performe his Covenant, it is then ſure. Now let us conſider both theſe in reference to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The power of God;</hi> power is neceſſary to give a being unto all underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; <note place="margin">The power of God.</note> If a poor man promiſeth much, yet there is no certainty of it, becauſe though he be very willing, yet he is very unable; the engagement exceeds his ſtock of ability. But God is able to performe all the good promiſed to his people in the Covenant. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 21. <hi>Abraham was fully perſwaded that what God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he was able alſo to perform.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the clear underſtanding of this, remember four particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>There is not any one promiſe of God, but hath the power of God accompanying</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">No promiſe of God, but hath the power of God engaged for it.</note>

Or whether the <hi>promiſe</hi> be for <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> there is the power of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Who is a ſtrong God like unto thee, that pardoneth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> He is able to pardon all our ſinnes, and able to change our hearts, and to ſubdue our iniquities, and to write his Law in our hearts, and to make all grace to abound, and to keep us from falling, and to preſerve us to his heavenly glory; <hi>We are kept by the power of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>This power is a ſupreme and over-topping power;</hi> it is an exceeding power; <note place="margin">This power is a ſupreme power.</note> a power that cannot be hindred; <hi>If he will bleſſe, who can curſe? If he be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No creature can raiſe up and ſtay it; it is ſuch a power as beares down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>This power is independent;</hi> it takes not in any aſſiſtance to help it, but is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <note place="margin">This power is independent.</note> ſufficient to it ſelf, and unto all its works, and unto all the purpoſes of God; there is enough of his power as to creation, ſo to converſion, and pardoning, and bleſſing.</p>

                     <p>2. <hi>The Will of God</hi> in reference to the Covenant, to perform what God hath promiſed. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 20. <hi>Thou wilt performe the truth to Jacob.</hi> Jer. 33. 14. <note place="margin">The Will of God.</note>

God was never forced to make it, or to enter into this Bond, but out of his own accord willingly became ours; and this willingneſſe was not extrinſecal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the perſwaſion of another; but it was intrinſecal, ariſing only from his own entire love unto us.</p>

As the <hi>Queen of Sheba,</hi> though ſhe <hi>heard</hi> much of the <hi>wiſdome of Solomon,</hi> yet ſhe found more than as much more when ſhe came and conferred with him; ſo beſides all the good which you have heard in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or have received from the Covenant, if you would ſearch further into it, you ſhould yet finde thoſe unſearchable riches of Chriſt, and ſuch depths and heighths of love and mercy, that you never eſpied before; there is much more grace, and much more love, and much more mercy, and much more peace than ever your ſouls as yet taſted of; you ſhall finde greater things promiſed, than ever you as yet have partaken of.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

You think this may be had, and that may be had, but you ſeldome come up with faith to believe that all ſhall be had; O Sirs, we frequently forget that the Covenant of God is a ſure Covenant, and ſure in all things; but let us ſtrive to raiſe our faith unto that heighth, and to that latitude, that all the Covenant is ſure; there is not one word of it which it ſhall fail, God will ſurely performe all his good promiſes of the Covenant; what you poſſeſſe, you think is ſure, yea, and all that God promiſeth is ſure; and therefore ſtir up your hearts, and look up to God with as much confidence for all which yet you want, be it never ſo much, and never ſo great, for God will ſurely make good all his Covenant to you; you have found the Covenant ſure in many things; O but the Covenant is ſure in all things; all the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Be not diſcouraged, nor deſpond, nor deſpair, for the Covenant <note place="margin">Be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</note> is ſure; there are foure times when our hearts are very apt to faile us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is <hi>long delayes of earneſt prayers;</hi> See Pſal. 22. 1. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me? why art thou ſo farre from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi> Verſe 2. <hi>O my God I cry in the day-time, but thou heareſt not, and in the night-ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, <hi>ſeeming diſlike and diſcouragement of ſeeking;</hi> Lam. 3. 7. <hi>He hath made my chaine heavy.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Alſo when I cry and ſhout, he ſhutteth out my prayers.</hi> Matth. 15. 23. <hi>He anſwered her not a word.</hi> Verſe 24. <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of Iſrael.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and caſt it to dogs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third is, <hi>a ſenſible contradicting or denial of our requeſts;</hi> as <hi>Heztkiah</hi> ſpake, <hi>for peace I have great bitterneſſe:</hi> So when we pray for peace in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then we feel more diſtreſſe and trouble in conſcience; and when we pray againſt temptations, then we finde more powerful and violent temptations; and when we pray for deliverance from ſinne, we then feel more ſtrong aſſaults and turbulent motions of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fourth is, when <hi>Gods dealings of providence ſeem quite oppoſite to his undertakings in his promiſe.</hi> Judges 6. 12. The <hi>Lord is with thee thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man of valour,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Angel to Gideon.</hi> Ver. 13. And <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</hi> and where are all his miracles which our fore-fathers told us of? <hi>Did not the Lord bring us out of Egypt? but now the Lord hath forſaken us, and delivered us into the hand of the Midianices, neither haſt thou delivered thy people at all,</hi> Exod. 5. 23. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> to whom God promiſed a Kingdome, but inſtead thereof, he was baniſhed the Kingdome, and his life was ſought for, and purſued by <hi>Saul;</hi> whereupon he concludes inſtantly <hi>that all men are lyars,</hi> Pſal. 116. 11. In all theſe caſes (and many more) we are very apt to be diſcouraged, and to queſtion (at leaſt) the ſureneſſe of Gods Covenant, and to cry out with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 77. 7. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe faile for evermore?</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies?</hi> Nevertheleſſe, notwithſtanding all theſe contigencies, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrarieties, and manifold delays, and ſtrange dealings of God with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his Covenant with them is ſure, and it ſhall certainly be performed; as no work of man, ſo no work of God doth or ſhall fruſtrate the Covenant of God with his people.</p>

                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:55323:84"/>
Therefore for the better ſupport of your hearts under all theſe dealings of God with you, carefully remember a few poſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are <hi>tryals of our faith,</hi> but <hi>no teſtimonies of Gods unfaithfulneſſe; He that ſits in darkneſſe, and ſees no light, let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon the God of Jacob,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. We think that we dare to rely on the word of promiſe, as a truth of God, as a ſure word which will not faile us. Now God by theſe contrary dealings, tries the faith of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; there is ſtill my promiſe to hear, and to do you good, and here to your ſenſe and feeling is ſomething directly contrary unto it; Can you in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on glorifie my good and faithful Word? Though all theſe clouds ariſe, yet the Sun will break forth; though all this befalls me, I ſhall yet ſee him to be the help of my countenance, and my God; his Word is a tryed Word, I will not fail; God who cannot lye hath promiſed: <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13. 15. why, Beloved! this is one principal end of Gods dealing with us, in ways contrary to his promiſes, namely, to try and to demonſtrate what our faith is in his promiſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They are reaſons of our patience, but no characters of Gods change; be ye followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. God is pleaſed to hide himſelf from our prayers, and ſeems to neglect them, in this he tries our faith; and God is pleaſed many times to delay his anſwers, in this he exerciſes our patience; he will be acknowledged not only as a good God, but alſo as a wiſe God, and his delays are not his deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, but only his trials, and therefore hear himſelf ſpeaking in this caſe, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>The Viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lye; though it tarry, waite for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry,</hi> Micah 7. 7. <hi>I will waite for the God of my ſalvation, my God will hear me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They are diſcoveries of many mens hypocriſie,</hi> but <hi>no evidences of Gods mutability;</hi> You ſhall have a company of men boaſt of their ſtrong faith in God, and of their great love to God, and how they truſt in him with all their hearts; this they ſpeak in the dayes of their proſperity; but let the Lord put forth his hand upon them, let him but blaſt their <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Guord, let him cut off thoſe armes of fleſh upon which indeed they do depend, let him but break down their creature-ſupports, and comforts, and hopes, and hold out never ſo many ſutable and faithful promiſes; why, they have no hopes; a word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is of no life or ſupport at all unto them: <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> ſaid that wicked Prince in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Behold his ſoul which is lifted up, is not upright in him,</hi> Hab. 2. 4.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They <hi>are many times the diſplayings of the beſt mens infirmities, but no tokens of any uncertainty in Gods Covenant:</hi> The beſt men though they may attain to the knowledge of the truth of that grace in their hearts, yet they may be much deceived as to the meaſure and ſtrength of that grace; and as many other things can declare this unto them, ſo do theſe delayes and reſpites, and contrary dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of God, much, very much ſhew it: Alas, what expreſſions (in ſuch caſes.) have fallen from the lips of precious men? what complaints? what impatience? what charges of God himſelf? what diſputes? what exceeding weakneſſes? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 11. <hi>I ſaid in mine haſte All men are lyars;</hi> thus <hi>David</hi> in that condition. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 18. <hi>Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a lyar, and as waters that fail?</hi> what a ſad expreſſion is this? <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Take away I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee my life from me, for it is better for me to dye than to live.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>I do well to be angry, even unto death.</hi> Job 3. 3. <hi>Let the day periſh wherein I was born, and the night wherein it was ſaid there is a man-childe conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You ſee what ſtrange weakneſſes God doth diſcover in the hearts of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by delays, by his dealings with them in ways ſenſibly contrary to his promiſes, by which they come more fully to know themſelves, and to be humbled before him, and to ſeek unto him for more aſſiſtance; and notwithſtanding all this, yet the Covenant of God is ſure to his people, he will yet performe all the good which he promiſeth unto them, though under all this they may diſcern their own weakneſſes and unworthineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They <hi>do ſerve for the greater demonſtration of his truth,</hi> and <hi>are no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutions of it at all;</hi> that notwithſtanding all viſibly contrary workings, and notwithſtanding all the fears and doubtings, and contrary opinions of his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet God will be true, though every man be a lyar; his word ſhall ſtand, and his Covenant be found true and ſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 22. <hi>I ſaid in my haste I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheleſſe thou heardeſt the voice of my ſupplications when I cryed unto thee.</hi>

Then <hi>be upright,</hi> do not uſe any indirect wayes or ſinful ſhufflings; what <note place="margin">Be upright.</note> need of theſe? the Covenant contains as much good as you need, and it is ſure for the performance of all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do good, ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſire of thine heart.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The ſuretiſhip of Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>of a better Covenant;</hi> (ſo I conceive the word ſhould be rendred, <hi>viz.</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and not Teſtament; for a ſurety is not of a Teſtament, but of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) A ſurety is one who is engaged and ſtands bound for another, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſable for him; as <hi>Judah</hi> for <hi>Benjamine,</hi> Gen. 43. 9. <hi>I will be ſurety for him, of my hands ſhall they require him.</hi> And in matters of contract 'twixt perſon and perſons, a ſurety is taken in for this very end, That the contract may be made ſure and good, may not faile, but be truly and perfectly performed; and the ſurety is a diſtinct perſon undertaking and engaging in the behalf of him who is of himſelf the more weak and inſufficient contractor. As to this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt is ſtiled the ſurety of the Covenant, becauſe he is a third perſon engaged not ſo much for God, as unto God on our behalf, that all that we are obliged for in Covenant unto God, ſhall be truly and faithfuly made good and performed; He (as our ſurety) ſtands bound to fill us with thoſe graces, to give us thoſe affections, and to ſupply us with ſuch a ſufficiency of ſtrength, as for ever to cleave unto the Lord in dependance and love, and to walk before him in truth, and to ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all out dayes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Mediatorſhip of Chriſt;</hi> you know that he is ſtiled the <hi>Mediator of</hi>

                        <hi>the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. You know that this is one difference 'twixt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works and the Covenant of grace; that had no Mediator, but this hath; there God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> as a righteous perſon, and <hi>Adam</hi> had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bottome and foundation for his ſtanding, but his own created righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as long as he kept that, the Covenant remained; and when he loſt that, the Covenant was broken, for there was no Mediator to make up the breach. But now for the Covenant of grace, there is a Mediator, upon whoſe ſhoulder the weight of the Covenant reſts; and as long as that Mediator laſts (which is for ever) ſo long that Covenant of grace ſhall laſt; This Mediator is Jeſus Chriſt, who (as Mediator) doth confirm the Covenant by ſatisfying for ſinne, and making peace and reconciliation, not ſuffering any enmity and difference to remain between God and his people; but he doth (if I may ſo expreſſe it) keep up the League 'twixt them both, by his merit with the Father, and by his Spirit with believers; by his Prieſtly Office he eſtabliſheth peace with God; and by his Kingly Office he eſtabliſheth the hearts of the children of God; his very Office (as Mediator) is to unite God and us together, and to preſerve that union for ever; if at any time we ſinne, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, who is the propitiation for our ſinnes; and when we are weak, he then puts out his ſtrength to conquer temptations for us.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things conſidered, it is clear, that becauſe of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, the Covenant of grace muſt be everlaſting.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>union 'twixt Chriſt and the people of the Covenant.</hi> That there is an <note place="margin">The union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his people.</note> union 'twixt Chriſt and believers, is moſt evident in Scripture; <hi>I am my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, and my Beloved is mine,</hi> ſo the Church ſpeaks of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 3. in reſpect of which union, Chriſt and believers are ſtiled the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> Eph. 1. 22. <hi>A foundation,</hi> and a <hi>building,</hi> Eph. 2. 20, 21. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. <hi>A Vine</hi> and <hi>the branches,</hi> John 15. 5. <hi>A husband</hi> and <hi>wife,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2.

This union 'twixt Chriſt and us, it hath two properties.</p>
                     <p>It is,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Unio arcta,</hi> a very near union; ſo near is that union, that (in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it doth anſwer the union 'twixt Chriſt and God his Father <hi>(John</hi> 17. 22. <hi>That they may be one, even as we are one)</hi> and that we are entitled with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name of Chriſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. and that we are ſaid to die with Chriſt, and to live and riſe with Chriſt; and our ſufferings are ſtiled his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. and the perſecution of Chriſtians, the perſecution of Chriſt; <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4, 5. <hi>Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Firma,</hi> a very firm and laſting union; therefore our marriage with him, is called an <hi>everlaſting marriage,</hi> Hoſea 2. 19. And Chriſt ſaith of every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever (who hath union with him) that <hi>he dwells in him,</hi> John 6. 56. that he will not loſe him, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. that <hi>he hath everlaſting life,</hi> ver. 47. that <hi>he ſhall not die, but live for ever,</hi> ver. 50, 51.</p>
                     <p>And indeed by vertue of this union with Chriſt, all believers do enjoy an everlaſting influence, and an everlaſting communion with God in Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>4. The <hi>love of Chriſt unto believers</hi> who are the people of God in Covenant, <note place="margin">The love of Chriſt unto believers.</note> the Scriptures are very high in the expreſſion of it; <hi>John</hi> 15. 9. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; continue ye in my love.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 2. <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Rev. 1. 5. <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>His love is a fruitful love, a watchful love, an intire love, a faithful love, an helpful love, and a preſerving and upholding love; is it imaginable that Jeſus Chriſt having ſo much love to die for his people that they might not periſh, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that leave them unto themſelves, that they may break the Covenant, and ſo periſh?</p>

                     <p>1. There are reaſons for this <hi>in reſpect of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>His Wiſdome</hi> hath contrived this Covenant in a way of everlaſtingneſſe, <note place="margin">His wiſdome.</note> which appeares in three particulars. 1. <hi>He layes the foundation of it not upon our ſelves, but Chriſt;</hi> not on our will and power, but on the power and ſufficiency of Jeſus Chriſt. 2. <hi>He engages himſelf for himſelf,</hi> and <hi>for his people,</hi> to keep them unto himſelf, and from falling, and to continue them to be his people for ever; not only to give them grace, but to preſerve that grace; not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne a good work, but alſo to finiſh it. 3. <hi>He promiſeth mercy to pardon the ſins of his people,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> to <hi>heal their back-ſlidings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>None of theſe were in the Covenant of works, and therefore that laſted not; but all theſe are in the Covenant of grace, and therefore it is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>His purpoſe;</hi> his purpoſe in making of this Covenant was to exalt, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, <note place="margin">His purpoſe.</note> and magnifie the greatneſſe of his love, and the riches of his grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto his people. Now there are foure things which magnifie God in theſe. Firſt, his <hi>graciouſneſſe,</hi> freely to make us to be his people. A ſecond <hi>is his goodneſſe,</hi> in the plentiful bleſſing of his people. And thirdly <hi>his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that he will ſurely bleſſe his people. And fourthly <hi>his everlaſtingneſse,</hi> that he will never forſake his people, and never will turn away from doing of them good.</p>
                     <p>Why, this exalts his mercy indeed that it endures for ever; and his love indeed that it continues for ever; and his grace indeed, that as it is free, ſo it is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. <note place="margin">In reſpect of his people. The everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingneſſe of the Covenant, is a juſt reaſon of perfect thankfulneſſe</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. There are reaſons for this <hi>in respect of his people.</hi> I will mention a few of them.</p>
                     <p>1.

                     <p>That a man may be made a child of God, and yet may become the child of the Divel; that he may be graffed into Chriſt, and yet may be broken off from Chriſt; that he may have true faith and grace, and yet he may loſe true faith and grace; that he may finde love and mercy from God, and yet may ſo ſinne, as actually to forfeit (and that for ever) all the love and mercy of God. Certainly this is a <hi>very ſad aſſertion,</hi> that any perſon ſhould be tranſlated from death to life, that he ſhould be delivered from the power of Satan, and tranſlated into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, that he ſhould be effectually called, and become a believer, and thereupon a Sonne of God, and heire of glory; that he ſhould for a while believe and rejoyce in his God, and be ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, and yet upon a ſudden (notwithſtanding all the love and promiſes, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God unto him in Covenant) his Sun ſhould ſet at noon-day, he and his God ſhould part and be utter enemies again, that he ſhould caſt off God from being his God: and God ſhould forſake and caſt him off from being any of his people; and as it is a ſad opinion, ſo it is an <hi>opinion utterly inconſiſtent with this truth of the everlaſtingneſse of the Covenant of grace.</hi> A relation which cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be, that relation is not everlaſting; and that agreement or Covenant which is broken and fruſtrated, that Covenant is not everlaſting; to be tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and to be everlaſting, are queſtionleſſe, inconſiſtent; neither will that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of a temporarineſſe on our part, and everlaſtingneſſe of the Covenant on Gods part, any way patch up the buſineſſe, becauſe there is no ſuch Covenant of grace which God hath made with his people. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. <hi>Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah.</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of Egypt, which my Covenant they brake, although I was an husband un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> ſaith the Lord; Mark the place, God makes no ſuch Covenant as ſhall be broken on our part, but ſuch a Covenant as ſhall hold and be kept on our part, as well as on his part; verſe 33. <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, &amp;c.</hi> And cap. 32. 40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The principal (if not the onely) ground of this breaking and falling opinion, is a ſuppoſition of a power in the will of man, according to the pleaſure and uſe whereof, the Covenant of Gods grace muſt ſtand or fall, muſt continue or break off.</p>
                     <p>And to ſpeak plainly according to the <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine, all the ſtability, and ſtate of a ſinners ſalvation, is made to depend upon the will of a ſinner; the election of God, the converſion of a ſinner, the beneficial Redemption by Chriſt, the perſeverance in Chriſt and grace; all of theſe do lie at the mercy of the will of a poor ſinner; and truly I muſt confeſſe, that if the Covenant of grace had no ſurer foundation then mans w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n mans will; we read that it is grounded on the

immutable counſel of God, and on his abſolute promiſes, and on his Oath, and on the blood of Chriſt confirming and eſtabliſhing of it, and on his power, and interceſſion, and preſence, and love, and Spirit, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But as to the opinion of theſe men (which indeed is none other, but that of the <note place="margin">To ſtate the ſtability of the Covenant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will of man,</note> 
                        <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Arminians)</hi> Give me favour to ſpeak a few words.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>It is very improbable</hi> that God would make a new Covenant with us, and ſtate the ſtability and everlaſtingneſſe of it upon the will of us ſinners; for hereby,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There ſhould be no difference (as to the ground of ſafety and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty) <note place="margin">Is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</note> 'twixt this Covenant of grace and that of works; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had improved the power and liberty of his will, he had continued, and had enjoyed the life which God promiſed unto him. Now wherein doth the grace of this Covenant exceed the other of Works, if eternal life be left unto the pleaſure of our will, as formerly it was to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nay it ſhould be harder, and more unſafe for us to be in the Covenant of grace, than it was for <hi>Adam</hi> to be in the Covenant of works; becauſe in that condition <hi>Adams</hi> will was created with a perfect righteouſneſſe, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſufficiency to have continued in that Covenant; but we are fallen with him, and have loſt that perfectly inherent righteouſneſſe; and the grace which comes in the room of it, is very weak and imperfect; ſo that as to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of the Covenant, we ſhould be extreamly diſadvantaged in compariſon of our imperfect holineſſe, with his perfect righteouſneſſe; and thus we by grace ſhould have only a leſs power and ſtrength to continue in Covenant with God, than <hi>Adam</hi> had.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God undertakes more for our part in this Covenant, than he did for <hi>Adam</hi> in that Covenant; for there he did give a ſufficiency of righteouſneſſe, and ſo left man unto himſelf; but here he doth not only call us to be his people, and give us grace to make us to be ſo, but alſo promiſeth and engageth his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his Chriſt, and the Spirit of grace to aſſiſt and uphold, and preſerve, and confirm, and ſtabliſh us unto the end.</p>
                     <p>Surely then it is not probable that he would leave the iſſue of ſo much mercy and happineſſe to the power and ſole pleaſure of our own will.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That God ſhould glory ſo much in making this Covenant with his people, and pleaſe to ſpeak ſo much of his great kindneſſe, and riches of grace and mercy, and of what he hath done, and will do for them; and yet when all comes to all, it is no more but this, if your will pleaſeth, you ſhall enjoy all this.</p>
                     <p>2. It is <hi>very incongruous</hi> to make the Covenant thus to depend (for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingneſſe <note place="margin">Is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous.</note> of it) on the power and pleaſure of mans will; it would rob Gods grace of all the glory for our abiding in the Covenant; for as the ſole blame would be ours, if we did break the Covenant; ſo the ſole praiſe and honour muſt be ours, if we (by our own wills) do continue and perpetuate the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; God will give this, and will give that if we continue ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that ſtedfaſtneſſe depends only upon the power and pleaſure of his will (God, ſay they, no where promiſeth that gift abſolutely, but we muſt look for that in our ſelves) And I beſeech you now tell me, where the glory of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance unto glory muſt light; ſhall the grace of God have it? no, it is not the fruit or work of Gods grace determining; then the man muſt have it, who did ſo manage and ſtirre, and improve his will as to hold out to the end; and thus by placing the laſtingneſſe of the Covenant upon the power of mans will, the creature gets away the glory from the Creatour; and Gods grace which ſhould
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55323:91"/>
reign in this Covenant, muſt loſe the Crown unto the ſuppoſed power and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mans will.</p>
                     <p>3. It <hi>is very uncomfortable</hi> to ground the laſtingneſſe of the Covenant upon <note place="margin">It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable.</note> the power and pleaſure of mans will; for hence it will neceſſarily follow, that you cannot (till the very laſt minute of your breathing) come to any certain concluſion of your ſtate in grace, nor of your portion in glory; Why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in the power of your own will, whither you will ſtand or fall, hold faſt, or break off relation with God; it may be you will, it may be you will not; perhaps your own corruptions may be too ſtrong for you, or Satans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, or ſomething from the world, and then your hearts fall off from God, and you are loſt for ever; ſo that it is impoſſible (by this doctrine) ever to have any ſettled comfort, fixed peace, or ſtedfaſt hope; becauſe all the happineſſe of your eſtate is but conditional upon the good behaviour of your own wills, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry changeable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But therefore we will pray the more to God, that our wills may not be led aſide from him, but keep faſt to him and his wayes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> True, and this is indeed a direct courſe to ſtand faſt in the Covenant; but then conſider, that this courſe will break the neck of that opinion which makes the laſtingneſſe of the Covenant to depend upon the ſole power and pleaſure of mans will.</p>
                     <p>For when you pray to God for his grace, and his ſtrength, and his continued preſence, that you may (thereby) continue with him in Covenant, you do herein deny your own power and ſufficiency, and you do acknowledge that you are ſtrong in his ſtrength, and not in your own might; and conſequently that the laſtingneſſe of the Covenant doth not depend on the power of the will, but upon the preſence, and power, and aſſiſtance of his grace, and ſo fall in with us, that the Covenant is everlaſting; not in reſpect of mans will, but in reſpect of Gods grace.</p>
                     <p>4. I will adde one conſideration more; it is <hi>not poſſible</hi> (I ſpeak <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is impoſſible</note> in reference to the Will, and Power, and Truth of God revealed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) that <hi>the people of God really brought into Covenant with him, ſhould break off the Covenant with him, and ſo make it mutable and voyd on their part;</hi> Suppoſe but this, that the Covenant ſhall not faile nor ceaſe on Gods part (that God will be but true to performe what he hath promiſed unto his people) I then affirme that it is not poſſible that the Covenant ſhould faile on our part; my reaſon is this, Becauſe the full performance of the Covenant on Gods part, doth eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and naturally include the performance of it on our part, and prevents all breaking and voiding of the Covenant.</p>

This God is our God for ever and ever. This makes the enjoyment of God to be a moſt happy enjoyment: His mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever, he loves us with an everlaſting love; O what happineſs is this to be the children of love, and to be the people of mercy for ever? Jeſus Chriſt yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and the ſame for ever; this is happineſs indeed, that Jeſus Chriſt

                     <p n="1">1. One is a <hi>privation of a contrary eſtate,</hi> and of a <hi>contrary Relation for ever:</hi> For if the eſtate or relation be changed, it cannot be everlaſting: and this ſhews the ſingular comfort and happineſs of the people of God, that their eſtate and relation ſhall never fall into a contrary eſtate and relation. They are in the eſtate of life, and they ſhall never fall into the eſtate of death; They are in the eſtate of ſalvation, and they ſhall never fall into the eſtate of condemnation. They are the children of God, and the members of Chriſt, and they ſhall never paſs into a relation contrary to this: Becauſe every everlaſting eſtate and relation is a perpetual abſence or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a contrary eſtate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond is, <hi>a continuation of the ſame being and relation:</hi> for whatſoever is <note place="margin">A continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame being and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> everlaſting that muſt continue, it muſt not be broken off? if it be broken off, it is not everlaſting.</p>
                     <p>O what a happineſs is this that your Sun never ſets; that your day ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, your God ſtill continues, and ſtill continues to be your God! your God ſtill loves you, and his love ſtill continues towards you; Jeſus Chriſt ſtill continues, and he continues ſtill to be your Redemption, your Righteouſneſs, your Peace, and your ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

But you ſhall never ſee an end of the everlaſting Covenant: Time is the meaſure of all the world, but everlaſtingneſs is the meaſure of the Covenant of Grace; as long as everlaſtingneſs laſts, &amp; as far as everlaſtingneſs goes, ſo long doth the Covenant laſt, and ſo far doth the Covenant extend. Everlaſtingneſs hath no end, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant hath no end: why! This heightens, and this ſweetens the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace! God is our God, and we are his people to everlaſting, without end: Though afflictions fall in, though loſſes, though perſecutions, though death it ſelf, yet the Covenant goes on and laſts. God is your portion for ever, he hath married you to himſelf for ever in loving-kindneſs, and mercy, and judgment, and faithfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>O Chriſtian, what canſt thou have more then to have God to be thy God? O Chriſtian! what wouldeſt thou have more, then to have God to be thy God for ever? A ſure enjoyment, a perfect enjoyment, and an everlaſting enjoyment: Theſe are the utmoſt of thy deſires.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Covenant of Grace <hi>hath a better foundation</hi> than the Covenant of Works: The foundation of the Covenant of works was that power of will and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was created: he ſtood upon his own bottom, and was left unto his own ſufficiency, like the Prodigal child, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. he had all his goods in his own hand.

                     <p n="2">2. The Covenant of grace <hi>hath better terms;</hi> All the Articles of it are promiſes: nothing is there required of us, which is not promiſed unto us by God: yea that <note place="margin">It hath better terms.</note> which was required in the firſt Covenant as a condition, is in this Covenant turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Obedience to Gods Commandements, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I will put my Law into their minds, and write them in their hearts, And I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people:</hi> And that which is required in this Covenant as a condition, it is likewiſe promiſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God; every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi>

The Covenant of works would not admit any perſon unleſſe he were righteous and inherently righteous, and perfectly righeous: (The Covenant of works was never made with the ſinner, but with the righteous) it condemns and caſts out the ſinner, but never doth accept of him or let him in.

                        <hi>brought into Covenant,</hi> than the Covenant of Works: The Covenant of work is very ſharp and quick, the leaſt tranſgreſſion (therein) doth undo the party (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Omiſſion or of Commiſſion) <hi>Curſed is every one that doth not continue in every thing that is written in the law to do it,</hi> Gal. 3. 10.

                     <p n="5">5. The Covenant of grace <hi>hath better promiſes;</hi> the Covenant of works (ſo far as yet I do underſtand it) had but one grand promiſe annexed unto it, and that <note place="margin">It hath the better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> promiſe alſo was but conditional, <hi>viz.</hi> A promiſe of life upon the condition of fixed Obedience: life ſhould be continued as long as obedience was continued. <hi>(Do this and live)</hi> But the Covenant of grace contains better promiſes, and more promiſes; it doth contain a promiſe of life upon better conditions than that of working: Life is promiſed upon believing <hi>(Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved)</hi> and beſides that, it contains promiſes of all the things that ſhall bring us unto that life; promiſes of holineſſe, promiſes of ſtrength, promiſes of perſeverance in grace: And promiſes againſt all the things which might break us off from the Covenant, and from the fruition of promiſed life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Covenant of grace <hi>is more indulgent</hi> than the Covenant of works: Thoſe ſervices which will not be accepted in a Covenant of works, will yet <note place="margin">It is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent.</note> be accepted in a Covenant of Grace: The Covenant of works doth ſo inſiſt upon works, that the leaſt mixture of diminution, or imperfection, renders the work uncapable and diſtaſtful: the work muſt be in every regard perfect, for matter, and manner, and meaſure, or elſe (as to that Covenant) it was faulty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. But this is not in the Covenant of Grace: weakneſſe in working, and imperfection of ſervice ſhall not be rejected. <hi>The day of ſmall things is not deſpiſed: The bruiſed Reed ſhall not be broken, The ſmoaking flax ſhall not be quenched: I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him,</hi> ſaith God in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word.

                     <p n="7">7. The Covenant of grace <hi>affords better pleas</hi> than the Covenant of works. If a perſon offend againſt the Covenant of works, his mouth is ſtopt, and he can <note place="margin">It affords bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleas.</note> plead nothing on his own behalf, nothing at all to ſtay the hand of juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                     <p>But if one ſins againſt the Covenant of Grace, he hath yet ſomething to plead for himſelf, why God ſhould not reject and deſtroy him: There are four things which he can plead.</p>
                     <p>One is <hi>his Relation,</hi> yet thou art our Father, and we are thy people.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond is, the <hi>merciful nature of God,</hi> ready to ſhew mercy, and to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply pardon.</p>
                     <p>A third is, the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> he ſhed his blood to make our peace, and to ſlay all enmity.</p>
                     <p>A fourth is, <hi>the very Covenant it ſelf,</hi> wherein God hath promiſed that he will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55323:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not caſt away, and that he will heale and forgive the back-ſlidings of his people, and though he will chaſtiſe them, yet he will not forſake them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Covenant of grace <hi>gives a better eſtate</hi> then the Covenant of works: <note place="margin">It gives a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate.</note> we have a better eſtate by this, then we had, or could have by that.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, That <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency enjoyed a larger meaſure of knowledge, and righteouſneſs, and had alſo free communion with God, without fear, and had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the creatures. But yet he had not knowledge of God in Chriſt: nor any communion with God through Chriſt, nor had he any manifeſtations of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel by the Spirit of Chriſt; and beſides all this, whatſoever enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Adam</hi> had which might make up a happy eſtate unto him, yet all that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was mutable and contingent: But now in and by the Covenant of Grace, our enjoyments are higher, and they are alſo ſurer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are <hi>higher,</hi> for now we enjoy God, not only as a Creator, but as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <note place="margin">Our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are higher.</note> we enjoy him a merciful, and gracious, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth: and we enjoy Jeſus Chriſt in a way of union with his perſon (being <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30.) and in a way of communion in his death, and life, and victories, and purchaſes: and we enjoy the very Spirit of Chriſt, as to all his graces, and comforts, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are <hi>ſurer;</hi> he enjoyed God, ſo as yet he loſt his God: he enjoyed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <note place="margin">Surer.</note> ſo as yet he loſt his righteouſneſs; and dominion, ſo as he loſt that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and had it not been for Chriſt (who was immediately promiſed after the fall) he had never found his God again, nor a righteouſneſſe again, nor any right of dominion again: but in the Covenant of grace all is ſure, and ſtable, and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: God is our God for ever, and we continue his people for ever: Chriſt is our Head, and we are his Members for ever: we enjoy the Spirit, and he abides in us for ever. The Covenant of grace is a better Covenant then that of works, <note place="margin">It is better in the way and cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration.</note> as to the <hi>way and cauſe of Remuneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a Covenant of works you muſt earn your wages before you muſt be paid your wages: your own doing is the price of your receiving, and your reward is as your work is; nothing is there expected as a bounty, and gift, but all runs there as debt and wages: <hi>Adam</hi> could never pray under this Covenant, Lord receive me graciouſly, do me good freely for thy mercies ſake: But it is not thus in the Covenant of grace, where he that deſerves nothing, may yet receive all: and the unworthy ſinner doth yet attain to the moſt excellent mercies (upon the ſole account of the riches of Gods grace in Chriſt) In the Covenant of grace God doth not reward us according to our ill deeds, nor doth he reward us for our good deeds. But he freely pardons the ill works of his people, and doth them all good, not for their goodneſs, but for his own goodneſſe-ſake.</p>
                     <p>In the Covenant of works you come to God, ſaying, Lord! This I have done, therefore bleſſe me:</p>
                     <p>In the Covenant of grace, you come to God, ſaying, Lord! This I need, and this thou haſt promiſed, O give it me, not for my ſake, but for thy truths ſake, and for thy Chriſts ſake: freely love me, freely accept of me, freely own, and bleſs me; I can ſhew no deſerts of mine, but I can ſhew unto thee thine own promiſes: I can find enough in my ſelf why thou ſhouldeſt abhor and curſe me, and yet I finde enough in thy ſelf and Covenant why thou mayeſt embrace and help me.</p>
                     <p>10. The Covenant of grace is a better Covenant than that of works <hi>in reſpect of a double efficacy.</hi> 1. Of helping recovery. 2. Of ſaving vertue. <note place="margin">It is better in reſpect of a double efficacy. Of helping re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Covenant of works <hi>never did afford help to recover any one ſinner:</hi> As that Commander ſpake of the Watchman whom he found aſleep (and therefore ran

                        <hi>ſinners, both unto themſelves and unto God!</hi> who lay the Covenant of grace ſo low, and impoſe ſuch opinions upon it, as if there were no difference twixt a Covenant of grace and a Covenant of works. Surely it is either temptation which lies upon them, or ignorance, or unbelief, that they thus ſtand off, and fear, and diſpute, and except, and queſtion, and many times conclude againſt all encouragements to be taken into this Covenant, and there to finde mercy, and reſt for their ſoules: truely they do many times turn the Covenant of Grace into a very Covenant of Works.</p>
                     <p>O but there is no mercy to be had!</p>
                     <p>O but not for ſuch great ſins!</p>
                     <p>O but for me! O but I can deſerve nothing! and bring nothing! O but the ſentence is paſt againſt me! O but I have nothing to make my peace! And thus they make the Covenant of Grace, a very Covenant of Works; no better then ſo; a Covenant without mercy, without grace, without a Mediatour, without a tender compaſſionate God and Father; no City of refuge at all, nor help to the poor ſinner at all: And when they are convinced of mercy in it, and poſſible recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into it, yet they think that God will not come off to this but upon very hard and difficult terms, uſually annexing the Legal condition to the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Why ſirs! what do you mean thus to wrong God, and his Covenant, and your diſtreſſed ſouls?</p>
                     <p>Either there is a Covenant of Grace, or there is not; either that Covenant of Grace is a better Covenant than the Covenant of works, or it is not. If it be a better Covenant, then the fallen and undone ſinner may finde relief there, and help there, which he could not finde in the Covenant of Works; for if the ſinner can be no more relieved by this than by that Covenant; it is then no better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And now ſee what a ſlurre you caſt upon the wiſdome of God, and upon the goodneſs of God, and upon Jeſus Chriſt, and upon all the promiſes of God: O diſtreſſed ſinner! If the merciful God, if the gracious God, if the giving God, if the forgiving God, if the freely loving God; if the Lord Jeſus as Mediatour and Surety, if all the promiſes of God in Chriſt, if all the offers of grace, if all the calls of the Goſpel may ſuffice to convince thee that this Covenant is the beſt Covenant that ever was or can be made for ſinners, with all ſuitableneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to the ſinners condition: Then diſpute no more, but pray for faith to give God the glory of his exceeding grace in this Covenant, &amp;c.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the managing of this mighty and intricate Point, I ſhall deliver unto you three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That none of the people of God in any age of the world (ſince the fall of <hi>Adam)</hi> had a Covenant of works given unto them by God (for life) but the Covenant which God made with them (for life) was a Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wherein that Covenant of Grace, under which the people of God of old li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, conſents or agrees with the Covenant of Grace, under which we do now live.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The pre-eminency or betterneſſe of this New Covenant, in a compariſon with that old Covenant.</p>
                     <p>1. That <hi>none of the people of God in any age of the world (ſince the fall) had a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">None of the people of God ſince the fall had a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works given them for life, but a Covenant of Grace, as</note> 
                        <hi>of works given unto them by God for life, but they had all of them a Covenant of Grace given unto them for life:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us (if you pleaſe) calculate the ſeveral Ages or times of the Church of God, and then you ſhall clearly ſee the truth of what I ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>As ſoon as Adam fell,</hi> God was pleaſed to ſet up the Covenant of Grace in the form of a promiſe, for he made a promiſe of Chriſt as a Saviour and deliverer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> Here is an expreſs <note place="margin">Immediately upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</note> promiſe of Chriſt, who is called the ſeed of the woman, becauſe he was to take our nature upon him: And the work or Office of Chriſt is to bruſe the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, (that is) Jeſus Chriſt was to conquer and deſtroy him: and ſurely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and deſtruction of of Satan imports our full deliverance from him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of us into the eſtate of freedom, and grace, and happineſſe: The which Chriſt doth by having his heel bruiſed (that is) by dying and ſuffering for us, and hereby procuring life and ſalvation. The Apoſtle calls it <hi>His putting to death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fleſh,</hi> 1 Pet 3. 18. And in this reſpect Chriſt is called the <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. becauſe the death of Chriſt (by which our deliverance and ſalvation is wrought) was publiſhed and promiſed from the beginning of the world: Now there is no Covenant wherein Chriſt comes in on the behalf of ſinners, but that Covenant is a Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, purſue this from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abel,</hi> and from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Enoch,</hi> and from <note place="margin">From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Enoch</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> it is evident they were not under a Covenant of works, but of grace: And I will give you one reaſon for it, or rather the Apoſtle will do it for me, who ſpeaking of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> he doth commend the one for his <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſacrifice,</hi> Heb. 11. 4. and the other for his <hi>pleaſing of God,</hi> verſe 5. and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55323:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both of them (and <hi>Noah</hi> alſo) for <hi>faith</hi> (for he adds in verſe 6. <hi>But without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God)</hi> whence I argue thus, That thoſe perſons who enjoyed ſuch a faith by which their perſons and ſervices were pleaſing unto God, and graciouſly accepted of him, thoſe were not in a Covenant of works, but in a Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Nay look on the words once more, verſe 4. <hi>By faith Abel offered a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſacrifice then Cain, by which he obtained witneſs that he was righteous.</hi> And verſe 7. <hi>Noah became heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith:</hi> verily a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by faith is no righteouſneſſe in a Covenant of works, but of grace: It is that righteouſneſſe through the faith of Chriſt, <hi>the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let us advance one ſtep further from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> where we ſhall hear <note place="margin">From <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                        </note> of the Covenant again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>I will make my Covenant between me and thee;</hi> and verſe 7. <hi>I will establiſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generation for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee:</hi> Here is a Covenant expreſly made twixt God and <hi>Abraham;</hi> but what Covenant was it? Surely not a Covenant of works, but a Covenant of grace. And that I ſhall clear unto you by four particulars which I pray you well to conſider and obſerve.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In this Covenant you have <hi>Jeſus Chriſt promiſed unto Abraham;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed was the promiſe made; he ſaith not to thy ſeeds, as ſpeaking of many, but of one who is Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Abraham</hi> (In relation to this Covenant) is <hi>ſtiled a believer,</hi> yea the <hi>Father of all them that believe,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. And the Goſpel was the means of his faith, which was a juſtifying faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He <hi>received the ſigne of Circumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 11.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Moreover it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, that they are in the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 8. 11. And of all the <hi>Elders</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a better Country, that is an heavenly,</hi> Heb. 11. 16. And this alſo proves that neither he, or they were under a Covenant of works (which never brought any to Heaven) but under a Covenant of Grace; for <hi>by grace ye are ſaved,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 5.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let us go forward from <hi>Abraham to Moſes,</hi> and there let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether the Church were under a Covenant of works, or of grace. That <note place="margin">From <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                        </note> God ſet up a Covenant in <hi>Moſes time,</hi> the Scripture doth clearly teach us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>If ye will obey my voice, and keep my Covenant, Then ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me above all people.</hi> verſe 6. <hi>And ye ſhall be un to me a kingdom of Prieſts, and an holy nation.</hi> Exod. 34. 27. <hi>After the tenour of theſe words, I have made a Covenant with thee, and with Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 4. 13. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto you his Covenant which he commanded you to perform, even ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and he wrote them upon two tables of ſtone?</p>

2.

                     <p n="3">3. You muſt diſtinguiſh twixt 1. The <hi>intention of God in giving the Law,</hi> and 2ly The <hi>abuſe or perverting of that Law.</hi> I do grant that many of the Jews did ſet up a Legal Righteouſneſs for their juſtifications and reſted upon the works of the Law, as if life came by them (againſt which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth notably argue in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to the <hi>Galathians)</hi> But this was not the intention of God in the Sanction of the Law: They never could find a juſtifying righteouſneſs by the Law, or works of the Law (under the notion of a Covenant of works) Nor did God ever propound it for that end: and becauſe I meet with this choice queſtion, I will briefly deliver my own judgement concerning it in <note place="margin">The queſtion anſwered in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> three particulars.</p>

                           </gap>ed</note> give you arguments to demonſtrate it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He did ſet up immediately after the fall a Covenant of Grace</hi> (this the Scripture clearly ſhews us) but a Covenant of works is inconſiſtent with a Covenant of Grace; and a Covenant of grace is inconſiſtent with a Covenant of works, They are mutually deſtructive one to the other. <hi>If of works, then no more of grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. So that you muſt either deny that God did ſet up a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace for ſinners (which the Scriptures affirm) or you muſt grant that a Covenant of grace is inconſiſtent with a Covenant of works (which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deny) or you muſt confeſs that there is no Covenant of works (ſince the fall) ſet up by God for ſinners.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If God did ſet up a Covenant of grace for ſinners, and after that a Covenant of works for ſinners, <hi>Then he did ſet up a poſſibility for ſinners to be ſaved, and an impoſſibility alſo for ſinners to be ſaved:</hi> The reaſon whereof is this. There is a poſſibility for a ſinners ſalvation, as to a Covenant of grace where mercy may be found; and there is an impoſſibility of a ſinners ſalvation, as to a Covenant of works, where no mercy is to be found for a ſinner: But for God to make ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation both poſſible and impoſſible for the ſame ſinners, were moſt inglorious and abſurd.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>To put ſinners upon contradictions, is no way ſuitable with the wiſdom and goodneſſe of God.</hi> But if God ſhould have ſet up a Covenant of works for ſinners, after he hath ſet up a Covenant of Grace, he ſhould have put the ſinner upon contradictions: you muſt believe, and you muſt not believe; you muſt be juſtified and live by works, and you muſt not do ſo. The Covenant of grace ſaith you muſt believe; the Covenant of works ſaith you muſt not believe. That ſaith, believe and you ſhall be ſaved; this ſaith, do this and live: what is this but to build up, and pull down; to offer mercy, and to deny mercy; to give life, and to take way life?</p>

                     <p>Therefore firſt I think it neceſſary to <hi>diſtinguiſh of that word (condition)</hi> which may be taken in a three-fold ſenſe. <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh of the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Puts ſuch a condition which is compatible with the grace of God:</hi> Indeed works (that is) a ſelf perfect, and abſolute obedience is incompatible, and inconſiſtent with ſalvation by grace; but a ſaving by faith is not inconſiſtent with <note place="margin">Requires ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition.

                     <p>Now from all which hath been diſcovered, it doth appear that the Covenant of grace can admit of a condition, namely ſuch a condition which is graciouſly given, and ſuch a condition which will in the nature and uſe of it exalt all the grace of God. And truely <hi>this condition is Faith,</hi> and no other thing; for <note place="margin">This condition is faith.</note> Faith</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. and Phil. 1. 29. It doth not (at all) flow from our ſelves. Therefore believers are ſaid <hi>(Joh.</hi> 1. 13.) <hi>to be born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And it <hi>is ſuch a gift of God as is compleatly adopted to the Covenant of Grace:</hi> (To no Covenant but that, and to that it is) For that Covenant on Gods part is all in offers, and promiſes, and givings; and faith is all in receiving, and is depending, and acknowledging, and magnifying the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>that Faith is the condition</hi> annexed to this Covenant, I ſhall preſent unto <note place="margin">Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it.</note> you a few Arguments (beſides the Scriptures above mentioned) to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it.</p>

                     <p>1. For God and unbelievers are not in Covenant.</p>

                     <p>3.

But conſider us as brought into Chriſt, now we are reconciled to God; and now in what relation God ſtands to Chriſt, in the ſame he ſtands to us; and in what relation Chriſt ſtands to God, in the ſame do we ſtand to God. And what priviledge Chriſt enjoyes, the ſame do we enjoy by Chriſt; he is a God to Chriſt, and a Father to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 26. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, &amp;c.</hi> And thus we being in Chriſt, he is to us.

Another is by a <hi>real participation of the life, ſap, and influence of the root:</hi> That which makes us to be in Chriſt any kind of way, is Faith: and according to the differences of faith are thoſe differences of being in Chriſt. You may read in Scripture of a <hi>dead faith,</hi> James 2. 26. This dead faith takes in an external profeſſion of Chriſt, and a ſelf aiming dependance on Chriſt to keep us from Hell, and get us to Heaven. But for all this there is no real union with Chriſt. And we read too of <hi>a lively and unfeigned faith,</hi> of a faith which joynes us and Chriſt in one Spirit, which graffs us indeed into Chriſt and makes us partakers of the life and grace of Chriſt. O where is this faith? this living faith? this ingraffing faith? this uniting faith is the only precious faith, and the only faith which brings us into the Covenant, and the only faith which can look on God as our God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing

The excellencies of Chriſt are hidden excellencies from the men of the world, and no eye can ſee them but the eye of faith; there muſt be <hi>a light ſhining in the heart to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 6.

So that none like Chriſt, he is the Pearle of great price; and nothing like Chriſt, no love like his, no enjoyment like the enjoyment of him, &amp;c.</p>

Now faith which brings a ſoule to Chriſt, hath parted that ſoule and ſin; it hath given a bill of divorce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin; it takes off the heart from ſin; what, ſhall I prefer hell before heaven? ſhall I prefer damnation before ſalvation? ſhall I for this ſinful luſts-ſake deny Chriſt? my heart refuſe to marry him who is the Son of God, the Lord of glory, the Prince of Peace, the Saviour of ſinners? <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols!</hi> ſaid <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſea 14. 8. <hi>Get thee hence,</hi> ſaid they in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 22. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein,</hi> Rom. 6. 2.</p>

If a man ſaith I will have my eaſe, and I will have my liberty, and I will have my pleaſures, and I will have my profits, and I will have my friends, and I will have my honours, and I will not have Chriſt with any loſſe or croſſe; this man loves the world, and this hinders union with Chriſt: <hi>The young man</hi> loſt Chriſt upon this very account, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 22, 23. But if Faith indeed be wrought in the heart, all this language is removed out of the way: <hi>Faith overcomes the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4. <hi>The Merchants ſold all for to buy the pearle of great price;</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26. <hi>We have forſaken all and followed thee, ſaid</hi> the Diſciples. When a man hath faith, he can be content to be Fatherleſſe and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, to be friendleſſe and landleſſe, to part with all rather than he will be Chriſtleſſe; Faith ſees enough in Chriſt, though he ſhould enjoy no more but Chriſt. Faith will enable us to trample upon the world, ſo that we may enjoy Chriſt, it will enable us to break off with all, and to breake down all to poſſeſſe him who is better than all.</p>

                     <p>O beloved, try your hearts by what I have ſpoken in this particular; you think that you have this uniting faith: But what hath that faith wrought upon you, and within you, to bring you and Chriſt together? It is not ſo eaſie a work to match Chriſt and the ſoule together; nothing can do that but faith, and no faith can do that, but ſuch a faith which preſents Chriſt in that height of goodneſs, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and excellency, that the ſoul is drawn out with that ſtrength and vehemency of deſire after Chriſt, as to part with all to enjoy Chriſt, &amp;c. And who hath found it thus? Is there not yet ſomething or other which ſtand between Chriſt and our hearts? &amp;c.</p>

a conjugal union twixt perſon and perſon, without which there is no conjugal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them, and upon which the relation is immediately made; ſo there are ſome acts of the ſoul immediate to the being of the Spiritual union twixt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Chriſt, without which there is no relation, and upon which there is an immediate relation twixt him and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>There are two acts upon the ſoule when the union is made between Chriſt and us.</p>

So by the Spirit he teſtifies his willingneſs and conſent to be ours, yea and that he is ours: <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, If you ſpeake as to the very uniting work, this is all that faith is to do, to enable our wills or hearts to give a right conſent to Chriſt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, to receive him.</p>
                     <p>

I cannot, or I do not cloſe with him: This kind of conſent is no other but a preſent diſſent, in which no conjugal union doth conſiſt; for it is only the preſent conſent and acceptance of the perſon which makes up that union, and which gives propriety and intereſt. And thus is it in the matter twixt us and Chriſt; not a future pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have Chriſt, but a preſent acceptance of Chriſt makes the match between us and him: When I come to be old, and to be ſick, and to dye, then I will be Chriſts, and then I will own and embrace him! well, but whoſe are you for the preſent? your union is where your preſent choice is, and where your preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance is.</p>

ſtrait of conſcience and fear of the wrath of God, and he knows that there is no eaſing of the one, nor eſcaping of the other but by Chriſt; and therefore he doth <hi>(de praeſenti)</hi> come in to Chriſt and profeſſeth that he is content to cloſe with him, only out of a ſelf reſpect, as one in a ſtorme comes under a tree. It is true indeed, that the conſent of Faith is a preſent conſent, but withall it is a very free and voluntary conſent; the heart is never forced, but perſwaded and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly allured and inclined to Chriſt (not out of meere exigency, but pure excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and that from the beauty and goodneſſe in Chriſt) when faith makes it to conſent unto Chriſt.</p>

Though a man hath not that Faith (of which we are diſcourſing) yet he may voluntarily conſent to take Chriſt with a reſpect to his Portion (that is) to the Benefits by Chriſt; with all his heart he may be willing to have the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to juſtifie him, and the Blood of Chriſt to get him the pardon of all his ſins, and the Merits of Chriſt to procure ſalvation for him; and yet this perſon cannot, and will not conſent to take the Perſon of Chriſt, and to take Chriſt as his Head, and to be his Lord, nor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a member of Chriſt, and a ſervant unto Chriſt, and Spouſe to Chriſt: This is a conſenting unto the things of Chriſt, but not unto Chriſt himſelf. As if one ſhould think to marry himſelf unto an eſtate only: But the conſent ariſing from faith is otherwiſe, for this conſent is immediately given to the Perſon of Chriſt, and therefore it is called a <hi>receiving of Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. And a <hi>marrying to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Hoſea 2. 19. Indeed when you have conſented to take Chriſt, then doth Chriſt (according to his promiſes) ſettle upon you all his ſaving benefits; but that which faith immediately looks on is the very Perſon of Chriſt, to unite our perſons to his own Perſon: To take him as our Head, and as our Husband, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſenſus-exceptionis:</hi> I call that a conſent of exception wherein a perſon <note place="margin">A conſent of exception.</note> yelds to another, yet with a reſervation, and with a proviſion upon ſuch and ſuch conditions, and not otherwiſe; as thus, I am content and do yeeld to take Chriſt to be mine, and my ſelf to be his, even in reſpect of his Perſon, but yet ſo, that with him I may enjoy my ſins, or ſo, that I may not hazard my eſtate by the match and ſo that I may not ſuffer with him. O no! Chriſt will never be yours, and you can never be his with thoſe reſerves and proviſions: <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſſe and follow me:</hi> As if a woman ſhould think any man would marry her upon this condition As long as you are rich, and at liberty, and in health you ſhall be my husband, and ſo that I may be an adultreſs: The conſent which indeed ariſeth from faith (which makes union 'twixt us and Chriſt) is a conſent freely taking Chriſt, and fully taking Chriſt, and immediately taking Chriſt, and ſincerely taking Chriſt; Chriſt and none but Chriſt, Chriſt and all Chriſt, Chriſt and all that may befall us with Chriſt; Chriſt at his beſt, and Chriſt at his worſt, Chriſt in Heaven as triumphing, and Chriſt on earth as ſuffering: A conſent to live with Chriſt and to die for Chriſt, a Chriſt upon any condition that Chriſt will make: And a Chriſt upon no condition that my vain heart would make.</p>

The union which is made with us and Chriſt by faith hath theſe ſeven properties or qualities.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It is real, and not imaginary:</hi> There is a work which is only in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <note place="margin">It is real and not imaginary</note> and apprehenſion of the minde, wherein though the ſpecies and formes and Idea's of objects are in our mindes, yet the objects themſelves are not with us, but are far enough from us; ſuch union as this faith doth not work. But the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Faith makes is a real union, even ſuch a union wherein we are indeed rooted or joyned unto Chriſt: Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this union twixt us and Chriſt, he expeſſeth it by that union which is between a <hi>man</hi> and <hi>his wife,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They two ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 31. (The man ſhall be joyned to his Wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh:) And Chriſt himſelf expreſſeth this union twixt himſelf and us, by the union of the <hi>Branches</hi> with the <hi>Vine,</hi> Joh. 15. 5. <hi>I am the Vine,</hi> and <hi>ye are the Branches:</hi> The Branches are really united to the Vine, and ſo are we to Chriſt; our union with Chriſt is ſo real, that our bodies are called the Members of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. and we are ſaid to be one Spirit with him, verſe 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is <hi>ſubſtantial, and not vertual only;</hi> it doth not conſiſt only in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception <note place="margin">Subſtantial, and not vertual only.</note> or participation of the graces and gifts of Chriſt; as if all our union with Chriſt were like our participation with fire: only in the heat of it, and not in the ſubſtance of it. No! But our union with Chriſt is ſubſtantial, our ſubſtance is united to the ſubſtance of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bone.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Upon which words <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt by the communication of his fleſh dwells in us, and we are his members, even by a natural participation: which expreſſion muſt be underſtood <hi>de re quae participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> for we are united to the very fleſh and ſubſtance of Chriſt; but not <hi>de modo participandi,</hi> for that is only by faith, and not <hi>per contactum;</hi> we are united to Chriſt not as wax to wax by a corporal contact, but by ſaith: His ſubſtance and our ſubſtance, yet by faith.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is <hi>total,</hi> and not <hi>partial.</hi> Not the ſoule only of a Believer is united to the ſoul <note place="margin">Total, and not partial.</note> of Chriſt; nor the fleſh only of a Believer is united to the fleſh of Chriſt; but the whole believing perſon is united by faith with the whole perſon of Chriſt: as in the conjugal union twixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> that union was twixt perſon and perſon, ſo is the ſpiritual union twixt Chriſt and us, of which that was a Type and Myſtery: Jeſus Chriſt is (in Scripture) ſtiled our <hi>Head,</hi> and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> not of one part of us only, but of the whole he is the Saviour; not of our bodies only, or of our ſoules only, but of ſoule and body, of our whole man; but then of ſalvation by him we partake not without union; and therefore our whole man partakes of ſalvation by him; then of neceſſity our whole man muſt have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him: Moreover as our whole man is united to Chriſt, ſo our whole man is united to whole Chriſt conſidered as Head and Saviour of his Church, not to his Divine Nature only, nor to his humane Natture only, but unto the perſon of Chriſt conſiſting both of the Divine and of the Humane Nature: and the reaſon of this is, becauſe we are united to Chriſt as our Head, and as our Saviour, which Jeſus Chriſt is not according to his humane Nature only as man, nor according to his Divine Nature only as God, but according to both as God and man: Hence is it that Chriſt and we are called <hi>one fleſh,</hi>

For it is one thing for the Divine and humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be united to the perſon of Chriſt; and it is another thing for us to be united unto thoſe natures in Chriſt: Again, the Hypoſtatical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in the union of thoſe Natures in the ſecond perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who is the Son of God by eternal generation. But our union is not ſo; we are not ſuch ſons of God by eternal generation as Chriſt was, but by grace, which he was not. Moreover our union with thoſe natures, is by faith on our part; but the Hypoſtatical union of thoſe two Natures in Chriſt, is not an union by faith, but by aſſumption of the humane Nature into an unity with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature in his Perſon.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This Queſtion although I finde it argued in the writings of very godly and learned men, yet truely (unto me) it doth ſeem to ſavour of too much cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and for mine own part (ſo far as I do yet apprehend) I do think it but a Scholaſtical nicity; for although you do finde Jeſus Chriſt revealed and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Goſpel, ſometimes as man, and many acts aſcribed unto his Humane Nature in reference to our redemption; and ſomemes as God, and ſeverall acts of his Divine Nature; yet (with ſubmiſſion to better Judgements) I do conceive that our union doth not begin firſt with one nature, and after that with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature of Chriſt; but our union is with the Perſon of Chriſt (as conſiſting of both Natures) at once. And my reaſon is this, becauſe our union is with Chriſt as Mediatour (with whole Chriſt) at once: I beſeech you conſider.</p>
                     <p>When the Goſpel offers Chriſt to a poor and diſtreſſed ſinner, it doth not offer Chriſt in one Nature firſt, and in his other Nature next; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel offers whole Chriſt at once; it offers (at once) Chriſt the Saviour, and Chriſt the Head, Chriſt the Redeemer (that is) the Perſon of Chriſt conſiſting of both Natures: And when the Spirit of Chriſt comes into the heart to joyne
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55323:110"/>
Chriſt to us, and when faith is formed in the heart to joyn us to Chriſt; why! the Spirit at once applies the whole Chriſt unto you; and faith at once looks on Chriſt as Head and Mediatour, and (as ſo) unites you unto Chriſt: Faith looks on Chriſt not in one Nature only, or in the other Nature only; but as a Mediatour, as a Head, as a Saviour, and under that notion unites you to Chriſt: It is true that the great works of Redemption, and ſatisfaction, and reconciliation appeared in the humane Nature of Chriſt, and are frequently aſcribed to his blood; and it is as true, that the Divine Nature of Chriſt enabled the humane Nature of Chriſt unto thoſe works, and gave (as it were) life, and vigour, and efficacy unto them, without which they could never have been done, nor have beene ſuch effectual workes: And it is as true that not any of thoſe workes were done in reſpect of any of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alone which did redeem and ſatisfie, &amp;c. But it was the perſon of Chriſt (conſiſting of them both) who did redeem, and ſatisfie, and reconcile, and ſave, and under this notion Chriſt offers himſelf; and we by faith do receive him. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>A</hi> neere union.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The union between us and Chriſt by faith <hi>is a neer union.</hi> And if I may ſo expreſſe my ſelf, an immediate union: It is (in Scripture) ſet forth by the neereſt of all unions here below. There are three unions here below, which are moſt remakable for their nearneſſe.</p>
                     <p>1. One is <hi>Artificial,</hi> as is that of a <hi>Building</hi> with the <hi>foundation:</hi> Our union with Chriſt is expreſſed by this, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. where Chriſt is called a <hi>lively ſtone,</hi> verſe 4. and a <hi>chief corner-ſtone,</hi> verſe 6. (and <hi>our foundation,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11. <hi>and we are</hi> called <hi>a ſpiritual houſe built upon him,</hi> verſe 5.</p>
                     <p>2. A ſecond is <hi>Political,</hi> as is that of the <hi>Wife</hi> with the <hi>Husband</hi> by marriage: And our union with Chriſt is often expreſſed by this alſo: In the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 19. and in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 31, 32.</p>
                     <p>3. A third is <hi>Phyſical,</hi> or Natural, as is that of the <hi>Head</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> and of the <hi>Vine</hi> with the <hi>Branches;</hi> under theſe expreſſions alſo is our union with Chriſt expreſſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 23. Chriſt is the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> Joh. 15. 5. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches:</hi> The union is ſo near 'twixt the Church and Chriſt, that Chriſt compares it with the union of <hi>himſelf</hi> with <hi>the Father,</hi> Joh. 17. 21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one with us.</hi> verſe 22. <hi>That they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> Not that there is abſolutely and in all reſpects that very ſelf ſame union of us with Chriſt, as of Chriſt with the Father; but that there is ſuch a union according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and to note alſo the marvellous neerneſſe of our union with Chriſt: Which in this differs even from the natural union, where every part of the body hath not an immediate contiguity with the Head. And yet there is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt member of Chriſt, nor yet the choyſeſt, but they do all of them ſtand in the ſame equal nearneſſe of union with Chriſt: Now that which I aime at in the nearneſs of our union with Chriſt by faith is this; That where faith makes the union, the heart of a perſon doth ſo immediately an entirely cloſe with Chriſt, that there is nothing whatſoever which ſtands between it and Chriſt; no love of ſin, no love of the world, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>5. The union 'twixt us and Chriſt which is made by faith, <hi>it is a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A full and a compleat uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                        <hi>union.</hi> The whole man is joyned to Chriſt, and ſo joyned to Chriſt, that it is joyned to no other but Chriſt: Faith doth ſo unite us to Chriſt, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we are no more our own, but his; all that Chriſt hath is ours, and all that we have is his; our ſouls are his, and our bodies are his: Faith brings in our whole man to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it unites us to Chriſt: It doth not keep back any part of us from Chriſt: It doth not beſtow one part of us upon Chriſt, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of us upon the world, and another part of us upon ſin; no, Chriſt hath all when faith unites us to Chriſt: he hath all our mindes, and all our
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55323:110"/>
affections, he is our deſire, and our love, and he is our delight, and he is our hope.</p>
                     <p>6. The union 'twixt us and Chriſt which is made by faith, it is a <hi>ſatisfying</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>A</hi> ſatisfying union.</note> 
                        <hi>union:</hi> When a poor ſoule comes by faith to be one with Chriſt, ſo that it can ſay, Chriſt is mine, and I am Chriſts, now it is ſatisfied, it hath enough, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed: As this union in the kind of it is moſt excellent, ſo in the ſenſe of it, it is moſt ſweet: Faith uniting us to Chriſt findes all ſuitabe good in Chriſt, and all happineſſe, life, love, mercy, grace, joy, peace, ſalvation in him.</p>
                     <p>7. This union 'twixt us and Chriſt by faith, it is a <hi>firme and inſeparable union:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        </gap>oken aſunder: and herein it goes beyond all other unions which are uſed to illuſtrate this union; every one of them is ſoluble, it may be broken off; the Head and the body may be ſevered; the Foundation and the Houſe may be ſeparated: The Branches may be cut off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rom the Vine: The Husband may be taken away from the Wife, and the Wife from the Husband; Yea the ſoule and body may be diſunited by death: But the union 'twixt us and Chriſt remaines for ever. There is not only a continuation of it all our life, but alſo in death itſelf; your very bodies ſleeping in the the duſt are (even then) in union with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I grant that the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this union may (in this life) be much interrupted, and many times be wholly darkned; but the ſubſtance of the union ſtill remaines: and I grant that the ſubſtance or nature of this union may be exceedingly aſſaulted by Satan, yet nevertheleſſe it continues and abides for ever: For Chriſt will never part with the believer, and the believer will never part with Chriſt: And moreover as no power in the world is ſufficient to over-power the Spirit of Chriſt, which on Chriſts part makes union, ſo no power whatſoever ſhall be able to conquer faith, which on our part alſo makes the union. This faith of union as it is produced by no leſſe power than that of God, ſo it is preſerved and upheld by the ſame power to the end. Neither God, nor Chriſt, nor the Holy Ghoſt, nor the heart of a believer will break this union; and neither Satan, nor the world, nor ſin can do it.</p>
                     <p>5. If your faith be indeed the faith of union, this will appear by theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <note place="margin">The influences and effects which do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and effects which do alwayes attend that union which faith works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>All theſe things are moſt certainly imparted unto every believer upon his union with Chriſt Jeſus; Chriſt communicates unto him his own Spirit, his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, his own Righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.

                     <p>Now that meanes is the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> this is clear in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom you alſo truſted after, that ye heard the word of truth, the Gospel of your ſalvation.</hi> So Rom. <note place="margin">The Goſpel is the means of faith.</note> 10. 17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> The Goſpel is therefore called <hi>the door of Faith,</hi> Acts 14. 27. and <hi>the word of faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. and the <hi>power of God,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. and the <hi>word of Reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19.</p>
                     <p>The Goſpel is the meanes of faith in three reſpects.</p>

Theſ. 2. 16. and <hi>God even our Father?</hi> Here you ſee that God is Father to Chriſt, and he is alſo a Father to all them that are Chriſts: And as Chriſt is the Son of God, ſo are we the ſons of God; and how come we to be the ſons of God? ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>As many as received him,</hi> to them <hi>gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe in his Name;</hi> why!

                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly our union with Chriſt takes in with it alſo our <hi>union with the Holy</hi>

                        <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> in which reſpect, he that <hi>is joyned to the Lord,</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17. and the Spirit of Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be given us,</hi> 1.

                     <p>O Chriſtians! Theſe are glorious things indeed: who would not ſtrive after union with Chriſt, which brings ſuch an union with it? and who cannot but rejoyce and triumph in Chriſt by union with whom he is thus united to the whole Trinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

take any poſſeſſion of his eſtate upon ſuch a vacancy and ceſſation.</p>
                     <p>But Theologically he is an heire who is accepted and admitted into the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſed and ſet forth, and given by God, who yet lives for ever to be our God and Father; and indeed our inheritance and inheriting is nevertheleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Father lives; but it is therefore our ſetled and bleſſed inheritance, becauſe our God and Father lives for ever.</p>
                     <p>Now that of which we are Heires (by vertue of union with Chriſt) <note place="margin">Heirs of what.</note> is,</p>

There is an eſtate of inheritance ſet out for him: what God poſſeſſeth, of that (according to his capacity and proportion) ſhall he be poſſeſſed of holineſſe, glory, happineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>All the inheritance which Chriſt hath purchaſed, and God hath intailed, or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or paſſed over unto you in his Covenant,</hi> of no leſs then all this are believers <note place="margin">Of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which Chriſt hath purchaſed</note> heirs: This is the inheritance, and the eſtate of which you are heirs; namely all the good ſet out for you in the Covenant by God the Father, and confirmed and ſealed unto you by the blood of Chriſt the Mediatour of that Covenant: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers are (in Scripture) ſtiled <hi>Heirs of the promiſe,</hi> Heb. 6. 12. <hi>of the grace of life,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 7. <hi>of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith, Heb.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Heb. 1. 14. <hi>of the kingdom promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 2. 5.

                     </p>
                     <p>There is <hi>Haereditas gratiae,</hi> which contains all the bleſſings deſigned for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment in this life.</p>
                     <p>And there is <hi>Haereditas gloriae,</hi> which contains all the bleſſedneſſe reſerved for enjoyment in that other life: Of all in the one, and in the other, are believers heirs; you are heirs to mercy, and grace, and righteouſneſs, and comforts, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I think therefore that the belivers condition (by vertue of his union with Chriſt) is very comfortable and bleſſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you be by faith united unto Chriſt, there remaines one comfort more <note place="margin">Chriſt will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and perform all that good unto us.</note> for you which is this, That as you are thereby heirs of all the good mentioned, and promiſed in the Covenant, ſo, <hi>all that good will Chriſt ſee accompliſhed and performed unto you; for all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. They are ſure and certain, are ſurely, and certainly made good: As God ſpake unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 28. 15. <hi>I will not leave thee untill I have done that which I have ſpoken to thee of:</hi> So Jeſus Chriſt (unto whom you are united) he will not ceaſe untill you be actually poſſeſſed of all that good which his father promiſed unto him from all eternity, and hath promiſed alſo unto you in time (in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) to beſtow upon you.</p>
                     <p>And there are four things which may aſſure you of this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſuretiſhip of Chriſt,</hi> which implyes not only his undertaking for us to God, but likewiſe the ſame for God to us, that God ſhall really make good to us, all which he hath promiſed unto us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> which is his everlaſting work of applying all the good which he hath purchaſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Donation of his Spirit</hi> upon us for the communicating of all good unto us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>intention of his Merit</hi> and <hi>Purchaſe</hi> which he laid out in our names, and for our good: He merited no leſs for us than all that good in the Covenant: No leſſe than all outward benediction, than all heavenly bleſſings, than Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Reconciliation, Sanctification, Conſolation, Perſeverance, and eternal Glory.</p>
                     <p>His Merit and purchaſe amounted to all this, and not to leſſe than this; and as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55323:116"/>
God is bound to give him what he hath purchaſed, ſo he hath bound himſelf to beſtow all this upon believers, who are united to him. <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 13.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The habitude 'twixt Chriſt as Head, and believers as his Body and Members;</hi> he is not perfect untill they be perfected.</p>
                     <p>And now I pray you that are believers, be you your ſelves judges, whether your union with Chriſt puts you not into a moſt comfortable and bleſſed condition, ſeeing it brings you into union with God, and every Perſon of the Trinity, and makes you heirs of all the good in the Covenant, all which God and Jeſus Chriſt will ſee actually beſtowed upon you.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Though this be true, <hi>yet is it poſſible that your union with Chriſt may be right: They in</hi> Acts 2. 37. were indeed by Faith united to Chriſt, although the firſt work appearing in them was the ſenſe of their ſins, and of Gods wrath for that ſin; and ſo was the <hi>Jaylor</hi> in <hi>Act</hi> 16. 30. effectually brought in to Chriſt, although trembling of heart firſt ſeized on him; and ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6. Therefore diſtinguiſh thus of this matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is a difference 'twixt <hi>an occaſion of looking after Chriſt,</hi> and 'twixt a <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh 'twixt an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of union.</note> 
                        <hi>principle which unites to Chriſt.</hi> The ſenſe of ſin, and the fear of the wrath of God, theſe are the occaſion of your looking after Chriſt; and had you not met with theſe, it is moſt probable that you never had minded Chriſt: And yet it was not this fear, but faith (which followed upon it) that did unite you to Chriſt; I ſay faith which ſaw the exceeding goodneſſe, and kindneſſe, and graciouſneſſe in Chriſt repreſented, and offered, and promiſed in the Goſpel, and thereupon drew your hearts to the prizing, and deſiring, and receiving Chriſt, with a moſt chearful and ready conſent and will: So that though at the firſt, and occaſionally ſome le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal operations and impreſſions awakened your hearts to look after a Chriſt for deliverance, yet it was the Goſpel by the Spirit working faith in your troubled <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh 'twixt ſenſe of ſin and wrath, conſidered alone and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantly.</note> hearts, which brought and joyned you to Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55323:117"/>
put us upon Chriſt, then we deſire Chriſt no farther than a preſent help, and eaſe againſt thoſe evils which do diſtreſſe us; but thus it is not with you, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (at the firſt) your thoughts were fixed upon Chriſt only, to deliver you from the wrathfull impreſſions in conſcience; yet upon the farther light and working of Gods Spirit, your hearts are carried beyond theſe; for you muſt now have a fruition of Chriſt; you have now coveted an union with Chriſt, and ſatisfied you cannot be without that near union; and truely this is the effect of faith graciouſly given unto you from God.</p>

                     <p>Thus you ſee into what a ſurpaſſing condition the Goſpel brings believers in Chriſt, and of what efficacy the Apoſtles exhortation of them to holineſs ſhould therefore be.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, not <hi>as God only;</hi> not <hi>as the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity only;</hi> not <hi>as man only;</hi> but as <hi>Theanthropos, as God-Man: As God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>As the Word made fleſh which dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the Father,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. <hi>As the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity incarnated, as</hi> Immanuel God with us: <hi>A Virgin ſhall conceive and bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his Name Immanuel,</hi> Iſa. 7. 14. with Matth. 1. 23. and ſo the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Mary</hi> in Luke 1. 31. <hi>Behold thou ſhalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and ſhalt call his Name Jeſus,</hi> verſe 32. <hi>He ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Son of the Higheſt, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father David,</hi> verſe 33. <hi>And he ſhall raign over the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end:</hi> So Gal. 4. 4. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, &amp;c. to redeem them that were under the Law:</hi> (And Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>bear our ſins in his own body,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. And to make <hi>his ſoule an offering for ſin,</hi> Iſa. 53. And <hi>by his death and blood to reconcile us,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. Col. 2. 22.) As Chriſt was God from all eternity; ſo in time he was made Man: True God he was. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>The Word was God:</hi> and true Man alſo be was. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>He did partake of fleſh and blood;</hi> and verſe 17. <hi>In all things made like unto his brethren:</hi> and Acts 20. 28. of him it is ſaid, that <hi>God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed his Church with his own blood</hi> (that is) the Son of God being made man, did ſo purchaſe his Church.</p>
                     <p>So then, Jeſus Chriſt is our Mediatour conſidered as God and Man: And the <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A Mediatour muſt be a middle Perſon 'twixt differing parties,</hi> equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from both, and equally drawing nigh to both parties betiwxt whom he doth <note place="margin">A Mediatour muſt be a middle Perſon 'twixt differing parties.</note> mediate. Now Chriſt who was God, by becoming man, is therefore a middle Perſon betwixt God and Man; for upon this account he partakes of the Nature of them both; and as he is neare to the Father as God, in like manner he is as near to us as he is man.</p>

                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:55323:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. <hi>A Mediatour muſt be indifferent, and faithful in the behalf of both parties,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He muſt be indifferent and faithful in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of both parties.</note> not leaning too much unto the one, nor inclining too much unto the others; not preſſing on the one ſide, nor prejudicing on the other ſide, but dealing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly between both, and evenly: And thus did Chriſt our Mediatour, being God and Man: He was (as it were) therefore ſo equally intereſted and ballanced on the behalf of both, that man could not have choſen a better; nor God have appointed a fitter; and neither a ſurer Mediatour than Chriſt. For as be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was God, it concerned him to ſalve his honour, and to give him ſatisfaction: And as he himſelf was alſo Man (and under obligation for him) it concerned him as much to lay out himſelf for the good and intereſt of man in procuring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and ſalvation for him. So that partaking of both their Natures as a Mediatour, he was thereby not only intruſted by both parties, but alſo a like engaged in the behalf of them both: And truely therefore was the Divine and humane Nature united in his Perſon, that ſo God and Man might be united and reconciled by his mediation.</p>

If he had been God only, he could not have ſuffered; if he had been Man only, he could not have ſatisfied, and merited.

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer.</p>

To the firſt <hi>(the form of a ſervant)</hi> doth not prove that he was not really <note place="margin">The form of a ſervant opened.</note> a ſervant, no more than in verſe 6. his being in the form of God doth prove that he is not really God: But he was ſo in the form of God, that yet he was true God; In like manner he was ſo in the form of a Servant, that he was alſo a true Servant: Nevertheleſs know, to be in the form of a thing may be taken two wayes.</p>
                     <p>1. Sometimes for <hi>a meere ſhew or appearance, without</hi> the truth of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof it is a form or appearance: Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome who had the <hi>form of godlineſſe,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. (that is) a meere outward appearance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſence, power, or ſubſtance thereof.</p>
                     <p>2. Sometimes for the <hi>evidence of a real being:</hi> for the word <hi>

                           </gap>,</hi> is alſo ſuch a form as grows upon, and manifeſts the truth of an Eſſence or Being; as the form of a Seal left in the wax, is an evidence that a true ſeale hath made that impreſſion. So the external way of Chriſt in his humiliation and ſufferings, his humbling of himſelf to the death, &amp;c. did (like a form) ſhew indeed that he was a true and perfect man, and were the evidences of the truth of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                     <p>2. To the ſecond alſo I anſwer, That there is a difference between <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſinfull</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What is meant by ſinful fleſh.</note> 
                        <hi>fleſh:</hi> A ſinful Humane Nature is one thing, and an Humane Nature is another thing: Chriſt was not made ſinful fleſh (his conception by the Holy Ghoſt freed

him from that contagion; and truely he could never have been made a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour for ſinners, had he himſelf been a ſinner) yet was he made fleſh, or true man: He was fleſh in truth, though ſinful fleſh only in ſimilitude, becauſe of his reproaches, and abaſements, and ſufferings; He was in the opinion of the world numbred amongſt tranſgreſſors, and accounted by men to be ſmitten of God, for his own ſins; yet this in truth was not ſo: For he was made like unto us in all things, ſin only excepted.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I opened unto you what a Mediatour is: The neceſſity of a Mediatour; that Chriſt is the Mediatour, and he only; that he is ſo as God made man. Before I paſſe to the other particulars, I will make ſome uſefull Applications from thoſe truths already delivered.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> It is a queſtion ſtarted and aſſerted by ſome, whether <hi>Filius Dei potuit ſponſioni ſuſceptae renunciare &amp; ſe ſubducere:</hi> The Remonſtrants (If I miſtake not) ſay that he might have done it if he had pleaſed <hi>Abdicare, &amp; negligere praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in compacto promiſſum.</hi>

                     <p>But this Opinion is falſe. For</p>
                     <p>1. When Chriſt engaged himſelf as Mediatour, his obedience of Righteouſneſs was a <hi>Debt</hi> which he was bound to pay; he became thereby our Surety and Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Father.</p>
                     <p>2. He then alſo <hi>was made under the Law,</hi> and under that he was not if the Law did not binde and challenge him to perform that obedience; nor yet could he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Law; for no obedience ſatisfies the Law, but that which the Law can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge as due unto it.</p>
                     <p>3. He did not come (as Mediatour) to gratifie a friend, but <hi>to do the will of him that ſent him:</hi> and this was the will of his Father, that he ſhould loſe none of them that were given unto him.</p>
                     <p>4. Why was <hi>Peter</hi> ſo ſharply reproved and ſilenced by Chriſt, when he wiſhed him to pitty himſelf? and in his agony he ſubmitted, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>

Chriſt did dye or ſuffer, but this is affirmable only of the Humane Nature of Chriſt: And you cannot ſay of the Humane Nature of Chriſt that it is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and infinite, and everywhere, yet this you may ſafely affirm of his Divine Nature by reaſon of that union which they call <hi>Hypoſtatical:</hi> The Perſon of Chriſt hath two diſtinct Natures, and the properties of both; And yet the Natures themſelves retain their properties incommunicable one unto the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Thoſe two Natares thus united in the Perſon of Chriſt were</hi> (if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <note place="margin">The two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures united in the Perſon of Chriſt were the Principles of all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and works of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> my ſelf) <hi>the Principles of all the Actions, and Paſſions, or Works of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Redemption:</hi> For unto them did both the Natures of Chriſt concur by way of communion, yet ſtill reſerving their own properties, and proper way of working, the Divine Nature doing what was proper unto it, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature what was proper unto it. Some of the works of Chriſt our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, were the works of his Humane Nature in reſpect of the thing done; but they had their efficacy, dignity, and value from his Divine Nature, in that they were the works of him who had the God-head dwelling bodily in him; And ſome of the works were the work of the Divine Nature, but yet they were done by the inſtrumental concurring of his Humane Nature: Wherefore as the Divine and Humane Nature did concurre to make one Chriſt, ſo the acts of thoſe Natures (diſtinct in their operation and vertue) did concur and contribute to make up the ſame work of Mediator.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

As it is there ſaid <hi>the Man,</hi> ſo it is ſaid <hi>the</hi> Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> That Man is the Mediatour who is Chriſt (the Annointed of God) and Jeſus who is ſo called, becauſe <hi>he ſaves his people from their ſins.</hi> But as meere man he cannot do ſo, it is no meer Man, but God who is the God of ſalvation: And although Chriſt might die meerely as man, yet as a Med<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the Mediatour there from God, ſaying, <hi>one God,</hi> and <hi>one Mediatour;</hi> thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle in another place diſtinguiſheth Chriſt from man, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle not of man, nor by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> yet hence it will not follow that Chriſt only according to his Divine Nature did call <hi>Paul</hi> to be an Apoſtle; no more doth it here, becauſe he diſtinguiſheth God and the Mediatour, that therefore the Mediatour is not God.</p>
                     <p>But now to return to the proof of the Aſſertion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Chriſt is a Mediatour in reſpect of both his Natures, as he was God, and Man; not as God only, nor as Man only, but as God Man; many Arguments there are to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it. <note place="margin">Arguments to prove it. Chriſt layed down his life and raiſed it again accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both Natures. He is our Prieſt, Prophet and King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to both Natures.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>According to what Nature Chriſt did lay down his life, and raiſed it again,</hi> according to that Nature is Chriſt a Mediatour (this cannot be denyed, becauſe Chriſt as Mediatour died, and roſe again. for us) but to lay down his life and raiſe it again, was an act of his Divine Nature, as well as of his Humane. <hi>Ergo.</hi> for he died as man, and raiſed himſelf as God.</p>
                     <p>2. If Chriſt <hi>in reſpect of both his Natures be our Prieſt, and Prophet, and King:</hi> Then according to both his Natures he is a Mediatour. But, &amp;c <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. He is <hi>a Prieſt</hi> as to both his Natures; This will appear if you conſider <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 4. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of Melchizedeck.</hi> Heb. 7. 2. This <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was <hi>King of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>King of Peace;</hi> and verſe 3. Without <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>without Mother, without deſcent, having neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life, but was like the Son of God, and abideth a Prieſt for ever.</hi> Why, here is a clear Type of the Perſon of Chriſt as out Prieſt and Mediatour, unto which Chriſt doth perfectly anſwer; and if as thus conſidered he anſwer to <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> then he muſt be (as <hi>Melchizdeck</hi> was) without Father, and without Mother: And indeed ſo Chriſt was in a different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to both his Natures; For as to his Humane Nature he was without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as to his Divine Nature he was without Mother: And moreover as ſuch a Prieſt, he muſt be without beginning of dayes, and end of life, which cannot be affirmed of him but as God.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> as Prieſt is ſaid to be like the Son of God: if ſo, then Chriſt as the Son of God is a Prieſt, but as the Son of God he is God; <hi>Ergo.</hi> as God he is our Mediatour: Jeſus Chriſt as a Prieſt muſt have not only a Sacrifice to offer, but an altar on which that ſacrifice muſt be offered: The Sacrifice was himſelf in reſpect of his Humane Nature; the Altar to ſanctifie that Sacrifice was his Divine Nature, and himſelf offering and ſacrificing was the Prieſt conſiſting of both thoſe Natures.</p>
                     <p>2. He <hi>is a Prophet</hi> in reſpect of both Natures; for in both his Natures he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales the will of his Father unto us: In reſpect of his Humane Nature he doth ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God in theſe last dayes hath ſpoken unto us by his Son;</hi> and in reſpect of his Divine Nature, it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>That was the true light that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> and certainly to open the heart and mind as Chriſt did <hi>(Acts</hi> 16. 14 <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32, 45.) is the work only of God.</p>
                     <p>3. He is alſo <hi>a King</hi> in reſpect of both his Natures: nor can his Divine Nature be ſecluded in this; for to call out a people to himſelf, and to renew their hearts, and to ſubdue their ſins, and to rule in their hearts by his Spirit,

                     <p>The anſwer is this, <hi>That whatſoever we are bound to do, or to ſuffer by the Law of God, all that did Chriſt do and ſuffer for us as being our Surety and Mediatour.</hi> Now the Law of God hath a double challenge or demand upon us; One is of <hi>Active Obedience in fulfilling what it requires;</hi> The other is of <hi>paſſive obedience in ſuffering that puniſhment which lies upon us for the tranſgreſſion of it, in doing what it forbids:</hi> For as we were created by God, we did owe unto him all obedience which he required; and as we ſinned againſt God, we did owe unto him a ſuffering of all that puniſhment which he threatned: And we being fallen by tranſgreſſion, can neither pay the one debt, nor yet the other: We cannot do all that the Law requires (nay of our ſelves) we can do nothing, neither can we ſo ſuffer as to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God in his Juſtice wronged by us, or to recover our ſelves into life and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour again: And therefore Jeſus Chriſt (who was God made Man) did become our Surety, and ſtood in our ſtead or room, and he did perform what we ſhould, but could not perform: And he did bear our ſins and our ſorrows; he did ſuffer and bear for us, what we our ſelves ſhould have born and ſuffered, whereby he did fully ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, and made our peace, and purchaſed life for us.</p>
                     <p>I will ſpeak ſomething unto both theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt did perform that active obedience unto the Law of God, which we ſhould (but by reaſon of ſin) could not perform:</hi> In which reſpect, he is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <note place="margin">Chriſt did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of God, which we ſhould, but could not perform.</note> 
                        <hi>to be made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> So far was Chriſt under the Law, as to redeem them that were under the Law. But redeem them that were under the Law, he could not, unleſs by diſcharging the Bonds of the Law in force upon us; and all thoſe bonds could not be, and were not diſcharged, unleſs a perfect righteouſneſs had been preſented (on our behalf who were under the Law) to fulfil the Law.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a <hi>two-fold Righteouſneſſe</hi> neceſſary to the actual fulfilling of the Law; One is <hi>an internal Righteouſneſſe of the Nature of man;</hi> The other is <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Righteouſneſs of the life</hi> or works of man; both of theſe doth the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: The former, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Internal,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. <hi>He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparated from ſinners,</hi> 9. 14. <hi>And offered himſelf without ſpot to God.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He knew no ſinne.</hi>

                     </p>

                     <p>Theſe were abſolutely inconſonant with the purity and with the dignity of his

Perſon, and with the Office of a Mediatour and Redeemer: But yet we ſay that Chriſt in his ſoule did ſuffer for our ſins, ſuch horror, agony, and conſternation as amounted unto <hi>Cruciatus Infernales,</hi> and are in Scripture called the ſorrows of hell <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>The ſorrows of Hell did compaſs me about)</hi> It was a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a very learned man, that ſetting iniquity and eternity of puniſhment aſide (which Chriſt might not ſuſtain) Chriſt did more vehemently and ſharply feel the wrath of God, than ever any man did or ſhall; no not any perſon repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and damned excepted.</p>
                     <p>And verily I think the reaſon annexed to prove this expreſſion is very weighty, becauſe all the wrath that was due for all the ſins of the Elect (all whoſe ſins were laid on Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6.) was greater than the wrath which belonged to any one ſinner, though damned for his perſonal ſinning: And beſides this, if you do ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider thoſe ſufferings of Chriſt in his agony, in the Garden, you may (by them) conjecture what helliſh torments Chriſt did ſuffer for us. Not yet to ſpeak of the curſed death which he alſo ſuffered; In that agony of his, he was <hi>afraid and amazed, and fell flat on the ground</hi> (Matth. 14. 33. <hi>He began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy,</hi> verſe 34. and ſaith unto them, <hi>my ſoule is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto death)</hi> and his <hi>ſweat was at it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground,</hi> Luke 22. 44.

                     <p>But truely ſetting aſide the fooliſh Tragedie of their exclamations, the matter in queſtion will be but this, Whether God were not unjuſt to give his Son Jeſus Chriſt to be our Surety, and Mediatour, and Redeemer, and Saviour? For as much as Chriſt could not be any one of theſe, for and unto us, but by a willing ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſins, upon himſelf, to be for them reſponſible unto the juſtice of God, in ſuffering thoſe puniſhments which were due for our ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> And whereas they do object that God might have freely pardoned all our offences and puniſhments without any of theſe ſufferings of Chriſt; I anſwer, This is no more but to quarrel with the love and wiſdom of God in giving Chriſt to be a Mediatour for us; and to teach God a better way to ſave ſinners, than he himſelf hath deviſed and declared, who will ſo ſave ſinners by his Son as

Mediatour, that both in his juſtice againſt our ſins, and in his mercy unto our ſouls, his own glory may be admired and magnified.</p>
                     <p>But now to ſpeak a few words unto the main queſtion, I ſay it is not alwayes and in all caſes unjuſt, but it is ſometimes, and in ſome caſes very juſt to puniſh one who is in himſelf innocent, for him, or thoſe who are the nocent and guilty: <note place="margin">The innocent may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for the nocent.</note> 
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Book <hi>de ſatisfactione</hi> gives divers inſtances, but I ſhall inſiſt only on two; as</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In <hi>caſe of conjunction,</hi> where the innocent party, and the nocent party do become legally one party: and therefore if a man marries a woman indebted, he <note place="margin">In caſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</note> thereupon becomes obnoxious to pay her debts, although abſolutely conſidered he was not obnoxious thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>caſe of vadimony or Suretiſhip,</hi> where a perſon knowing the weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient condition of another, doth yet voluntarily put forth himſelf, and will <note place="margin">In caſe of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip.</note> be bound to the Creditor for him as his ſurety to anſwer for him; by reaſon of which ſuretiſhip the Creditor may come upon him, and deale with him as he might have dealt with the principal Debt or himſelf: And this courſe we do ordinarily take with Sureties for the recovery of our right without any violation of juſtice: Now both theſe are exactly appliable to the buſineſs in hand; for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was pleaſed to marry our nature unto himſelf; he did partake of our fleſh and blood, and became Man and one with us: And beſides that, he did both by the will of his Father, and his own free conſent become our Surety, and was content to ſtand in our ſtead or room, ſo as to be made ſin and curſe for us (that is) to have all our debts and ſorrows, all our ſins and puniſhments laid upon him, and did engage himſelf to ſatisfie God by bearing and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we ſhould have born and ſuffered: And therefore although Jeſus Chriſt (abſolutely conſidered in himſelf) was innocent, and had no ſin inherent in himſelf, which therefore might make him lyable to death, and wrath, and curſe, yet by becoming one with us, and ſuſtaining the Office of our Surety, our ſins were laid on him, and our ſins being laid upon him, he made himſelf (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) obnoxious (and that juſtly) to all thoſe puniſhments which he did ſuffer for our ſins. I do confeſs that had Chriſt been unwilling, and forced into this Suretiſhip, or had any detriment or prejudice riſen to any party concerned in this tranſaction, then ſome complaint might have been made concerning the juſtice of God. But,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>There was a willingneſs on all ſides for the paſſive work of Christ: His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

Now whatſoever death, or wrath, or curſe God hath threatned againſt ſin, God will certainly inflict it one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will do ſo: Although for a time he may forbear the ſinner, yet in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time he will be avenged on the ſinner: His threatned wrath will be poured forth, his juſtice will never put up the diſhonour, and the provocations, and the injuries which we by our ſins have offered unto it: Our ſins muſt and ſhall be puniſhed (and we ſhall not eſcape) either in our own perſons muſt we ſuffer for them, or elſe they muſt be ſuſtained in the Perſon of a Mediatour; death, and wrath, and curſe are ſo neceſſarily entailed on ſin, that God will as ſoon ceaſe to be a juſt God, as he will alter the inflictings of them; hence it was that Jeſus Chriſt was made Man, and did ſuffer; for juſtice would not be ſatisfied without either our own ſuffering of an eternal duration, or Chriſts ſufferings which were of an eternal worth for ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>It is dreadful;</hi> the very glancings of it, or ſhadows into which the godly <note place="margin">How dreadfull it is.</note> ſometimes fall, do extreamly aſtoniſh them; and the vials of it poured on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the ungodly, do infinitely diſtract and ſink them: but above all the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual influence which we finde of it on Chriſt himſelf, that is a plain demonſtration of the dreadfulneſs of the wrath of God: Queſtionleſs the weight of it is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly heavy, which made the very Son of God (though ſupported with his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to fall flat on the earth, to ſweat drops of blood, to be amazed, to be in an agony, and to fear, and to cry out, My God, my God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When we Miniſters preach againſt your ſins, and tell you of the ſeverity of Gods juſtice and wrath which will befall you for them, you make light of them, but you will finde (one day) that it is a fearful thing to fal into the hands of the living God, and that God is a conſuming fire, and that none is able to dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings. Why! If the wrath of his juſtice, if the drinking of that cup were ſo amaſing and ſinking unto Chriſt himſelf; what will it be to ſinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who are utterly deſerving of the utmoſt of that wrath, and who are utterly deſtitute of ſuch a power to ſuſtain them, and deliver them as Chriſt had!</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Behold your ſins, what they will bring upon you, if you get not your part</hi>

Chriſt was amazed, and ſo ſhall you; and Chriſt was afraid, and ſo ſhall you; and Chriſt was in an agony, and ſo ſhall you; and Chriſt did drink the cup of his Fathers wrath, ſo ſhall you; and Chriſt was made a curſe, and ſo ſhall you.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, a repenting and believing perſon may look upon the ſufferings of Chriſt with joy and hope; but an impenitent and unbelieving perſon muſt look upon them with confuſion and horror: The more he ſees of Chriſt ſorrows, and the ſharper he findes Chriſts ſorrows, the more perplexed may his ſoule be: For what puniſhments Chriſt did ſuffer for ſin, as to the ſubſtance, that ſame muſt the impenitent and unbelieving perſon ſuffer, as to the ſubſtance, yea and as to the circumſtance of puniſhment.

And his ſatisfaction muſt have not only a proportion, but alſo an equal correſpondency with the guilt of all thoſe Sins.

                     <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> divide this great work 'twixt Chriſt and ſinners: As they do about Mediatorſhip, they hold that Chriſt only is the <hi>Mediator of Redemption,</hi> but then they make many <hi>Mediators of Interceſſion;</hi> ſo do they deale in the work of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

                     <p>But againſt this proud and vain glorious Opinion, we thus reply. <note place="margin">Popiſh ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions confuted</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt did bear all our ſins</hi> (they were all laid upon him) as he did bear all our ſorrows, and he did Redeem us from all iniquity; And he gave himſelf <hi>Antilutron,</hi> a Ranſome and a ſufficient Price for them: If ſo, then there remaines nothing for us to ſatisfie for: Either Chriſt took on him to pay all our debt, or he did not; and did pay it, or did not; if he took upon him the whole debt, and paid it, then there is no room for our ſatisfactions; if he did not, how was he then our Surety, and how can his death be called a ſufficient price?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt did ſo fully ſatisfie God that all our ſins be forgiven;</hi> Then there can be no place admitted for mans ſatisfaction; for where ſinnes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, there the ſinner is looſed in point of any further ſatisfaction) And beſides that, all ſatisfactory puniſhment falls off upon the remiſſion of ſinnes, (foraſmuch as <hi>omnis paena fundatur in reatu.</hi> Puniſhments cannot juſtly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but where the guilt of ſin remains unſatisfied; a guiltleſſe perſon may not be puniſhed, why ſhould he? for ſin committed? but that is pardoned; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? that were unjuſt.)

It is ſtrange how theſe men are ſet againſt Jeſus Chriſt, and will by no means be beholding unto him for any ſatisfaction, or juſtification, or mercy: But let us ſearch the Scriptures, and be led by them, and we ſhall finde that the forgiveneſſe of our ſins hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance both on the free mercy of God, and on the ſufferings of Chriſt.

                     <p>In reſpect of Chriſt, Remiſſion of ſins is not the effect of mercy, but of juſtice; it did coſt him dear, for he ſuffered and ſatisfied for our ſins, paid our debts; and therefore it is juſt with God for Chriſts ſake to forgive our ſins.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Our ſins</hi> in Scripture are ſometimes called <hi>Bonds</hi> (and indeed they are the heavieſt and dreadfulleſt Bonds of all others, lying heavy upon the conſcience, and binding us over to Gods Tribunal to anſwer) but theſe are looſened and relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And ſometimes they are called <hi>Debts</hi> (for the payment of which we do owe unto the juſtice of God, the endurance of everlaſting pain in ſoul and in body) but theſe debts are forgiven us for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                     <p>In every ſin there are two things conſiderable; One is, the <hi>Offence</hi> done to God, by reaſon whereof he is diſpleaſed; The other is, the <hi>Obligation of that perſon ſo offending God unto everlaſting wrath and condemnation:</hi> And both theſe are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the remiſſion or forgiveneſs of ſins; the offence or fault is removed; God is not now offended or diſpleaſed with the offending ſinner any more; and the obligation unto eternal wrath and condemnation is ſo far cancelled, that it ſhall never redound unto the perſon: Although guilt and obligation be natural unto, and inſeparable from ſin, yet this obligation ſhall never be put in ſuit; nor ſhall that wrath and condemnation (deſerved by ſin) be ever inflicted on the ſinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a forgiveneſs of ſin wrought by Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, That <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. (that is) not laying of them to their charge, not ſuing of them, not reckoning with them, but forgiving them.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Yes. And there are five Arguments to ſatisfie us concerning this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (as our Surety) <hi>took upon him the whole ſtate of our ſinfull debts:</hi> He did not undertake this or that particular ſin only, but the whole debt, the whole reckoning, all the ſins of which we might be conceived guilty, and of all of them gave himſelf a Sacrifice to put away ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He did ſo ſatisfie Gods juſtice for our ſins, as that there is now no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

to them that are in him; and verily, if all condemnation be removed, then all ſin is pardoned: If any one ſin remained unpardoned, then condemnation would ſtill be in force upon us for that one ſin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His death was a price Aequivalent unto the merits of all our ſins, and prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating them; and God having accepted thereof, it would be unjuſt in him not to remit all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All enmity is ſlain by the blood of Chriſt between God and us. <hi>He hath reconciled us by his Croſſe, having ſlain enmity thereby.</hi> But if any ſin was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, all hoſtility is not ſlain.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The great end of Chriſts death was to ſave us, to make us bleſſed, to bring us to the enjoyment of eternal life, which end could never be attained, unleſſe God did (upon the account of Chriſt) give unto us a plenary and total remiſſion of ſins: Becauſe of any one ſin unpardoned the wages <hi>is death,</hi> which the Apoſtle delivers in oppoſition <hi>to eternal life,</hi> Rom, 6. 23.</p>
                     <p>3.

                        <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Whereas formerly we lay under the wrath of God deſerved by ſin; we are now by Chriſt delivered from that wrath; God is appeaſed, and we are received into favour and friendſhip with him.

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny all this; they deny that God was ever angry or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with us, or that any of us did lie under his wrath, or that ever Chriſt did appeaſe, pacifie, remove the wrath of God, or wrought Reconciliation 'twixt God and us.</p>
                     <p>Againſt which Opinion of theirs, I ſhall lay down theſe Concluſions. <note place="margin">Concluſions layed down againſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians. There was a real breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man by ſin.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>That there was a real breach, or difference, or enmity made between God and Man by reaſon of ſin,</hi> and we were under his wrath for it. The Scripture is clear for this, calling ſin an <hi>enmity.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 16. <hi>Having ſlain the enmity thereby.</hi> Rom. 8. 7. <hi>The wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity againſt God: It is not ſubject to the Law of God, &amp;c.</hi> Sinners enemies <hi>(It when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.) Thoſe whom he calls <hi>Sinners,</hi> verſe 8. he calls <hi>Enemies,</hi> verſe 10. Col. 1. 21. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mindes by wicked works, yet now he hath reconciled:</hi> Here you ſee that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin we are alienated, and we are enemies; Alienated in reſpect of the near union and conjunction which (once) we had with God; and enemies in reſpect of that hoſtility which did ariſe 'twixt us and God by reaſon of ſin; Sinners do hate God as their enemy, and God doth hate them as his enemies; and their wayes are an abomination unto him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 9.</p>
                     <p>And truely becauſe ſin is in its own nature the greateſt diſſimilitude with, and repugnancy unto the nature of God, as it therefore breaks up all friendſhip, ſo it likewiſe raiſes up the ſtrongeſt alienation and hoſtility: But beſides this, the Scripture doth as clearly hold out the wrath of God under which men lie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> He ſaith not <hi>Non veniet ſuper eum, ſed manet: Jamdudum enim involvit omnes Adami filios, &amp; illis ſupe incumbet donec removeatur per Chriſtum Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin:</hi> Rom. 1. 18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe, and unrighteouſneſſe of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> Doth God reveal, and threaten, and inflict wrath upon ſinners, and yet is he not wrath with ſin or with ſinners? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 3. <hi>And were by nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> How often do we read of the provocation of God by ſin, and of Gods abhorring of people for ſin, and of caſting them out of his ſight, and of the ſeparation which ſin makes, and of his forſaking, and puniſhing, and damning of ſinners? certainly then ſin makes a real breach and enmity 'twixt God and us.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt (as our Mediatour) did ſtep in between God and us, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jeſus Chriſt did ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us to make up the breach. He did appeaſe the wrath of God.</note>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To thoſe that make this Objection againſt the need of our Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by Chriſt, becauſe of Gods eternal love; I would intreat them to conſider that place in 1 Joh. 4. 10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that God loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our ſinnes:</hi> Mark the place; though God did love us, yet he ſends his Son to be the Propitiation for our ſins; whence it is moſt evident that a Propitiation or Reconciliation by Chriſt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, notwithſtanding the love of God towards us. Nevertheleſſe I will not thus quit the Objection and difficulty, unto which divers anſwers are given by learned men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One faith that God did in a wonderfull way love us, when yet he did hate us, and was diſpeaſed with us; he did love us in reſpect of what himſelf had made, and yet he did hate us, and was diſpleaſed with what we our ſelves did make (that is) he loved our nature which himſelf made, but hated the ſin which our nature contracted: And therefore though he loved our natures which himſelf made, yet there was a need of Reconciliation to be made, to remove that hatred and wrath which we contracted by our ſins; and as <hi>Aquinas</hi> adds, to take away the cauſe and ground of all hatred and diſpleaſure in God, namely by taking away of ſin by the death of Chriſt, which was the cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But with your favour; I ſhall (I ſuppoſe) ſatisfie the doubt by a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a two-fold love of God.</p>
                     <p>1. There is <hi>Amor benevolentiae,</hi> which is that love in God by which he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and intendeth good unto us: For although God was angry and diſpleaſed with us by reaſon of ſin, yet that anger was not ſuch as did ſhut up thoughts of love and mercy towards us: For notwithſtanding that exceeding diſpleaſure with us for ſin, yet his love did intend, and did iſſue forth a way of Reconciliation and Pacification by the blood of Chriſt: And with this love, the wrath of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtent, and with this wrath of God his love is conſiſtent; he was wroth with us for our ſins, yet he did ſo far love us, as to give Jeſus Chriſt for the pacification of that wrath, according to that forementioned place in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                     <p>2. There is <hi>Amor amicitiae,</hi> which conſiſts in laying aſide all wrath, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of us into a league of favour and kindneſs: With this love (I grant) that wrath cannot conſiſt: And this love was procured unto us by the death of Chriſt: So then although God did love his people with an eternal love of benevolence, out of his meere mercy and grace; yet there is a love of friendſhip, with which he did not love us, until his wrath againſt us for our ſins were removed by the death of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> And whereas it was objected, that there needs no Reconciliation to be made 'twixt friends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I grant it: But God and we were not made friends but by the blood of Chriſt, which did pacifie his wrath againſt us: notwithſtanding his love of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, we were in a condition of wrath; and that love of benevolence did not take away wrath, although it did make a way thereto by ſending Jeſus Chriſt to be a Propitiation for our ſins.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>How powerful and efficacious the blood of Chriſt is!</hi> It hath done that which all the righteous men on earth, and which all the Angels in heaven could never do. If all the righteous men on earth ſhould have come forth and offered their lives, their ſouls and bodies unto God, and have ſaid, Lord, take all theſe at our hands, ſo that thou wilt be reconciled and at peace with ſuch a ſinner; they could not have made his peace: Yea if all the angels in heaven had offered themſelves to God, and ſaid, Lord, we are content to be put out of Heaven, ſo that this may ſatisfie thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and ſo that this may make peace for ſinners, neither would this have took up the difference and made peace: There cannot be found in any creature ſufficiency enough to be a Peace-maker, to be a Dayes man betwen God and ſinners, to take off the wrath of God due to a ſinner: No, no, it is not our tears, nor our confeſſions, nor our repentance, which can make reconciliation; it is Jeſus Chriſt only: He was only able to open the book, and he only is able to ſhut the book: None but Chriſt, and nothing but the blood of Chriſt is able to ſatisfie and to pacifie God: His blood was the blood of attonement or reconciliation, and the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him: The debt was ſo great, and the provocation by ſin was ſo high, and the wrath of God againſt ſin was ſo infinite, that nothing could diſcharge that debt and pacifie that wrath, but the blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>and us to God,</hi> and hath made peace! O ſaid <hi>Luther</hi> concerning the 118. Pſalm; I am more beholding to this Pſalm than to all the Potentates of the world: This Pſalm hath done more for me in my diſtneſs, than all the world could do for me: we may much more ſay that of Jeſus Chriſt, we are more bound to Chriſt than to all the world beſides; for Chriſt hath done more for us; why? becauſe he hath reconciled us to God; we had laine under the wrath of God for ever, had it not been for Chriſt: and we ſhould never have ſeen the face of God, had it not been for Chriſt: He hath pacified his wrath, and brought us into favour and friendſhip again: O ſirs, ponder it well what I am about to ſpeak unto you, that you may know how much you are beholding to Chriſt. What a miſerable unhappy creature is the ſinner who is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God, and at variance with him, and whiles he is ſeparated from God! God only is happineſs, and nothing can be our happineſs but the enjoyment of him; and therefore the falling away from God, and the ſeparation from him is an infinite loſſe, and miſery and infelicity: <hi>Cain</hi> thought it a peculiar curſe, <hi>I ſhall be hid from thy face!</hi> And the Church cries out, <hi>he bides his face from us:</hi> why I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the darkneſs, the loſſe, the curſe, the death, the hell of this, that the ſinner is fallen out with God, he hath forſaken God, and God hath forſaken him; he is none of Gods, and God is none of his, he is an enemy to God and oppoſeth him, and God is an enemy to the ſinner, and doth abhor, and will curſe him: but beſides this, conſider alſo how terrible the wrath of God is, and how dreadful it is for a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be a child of wrath, and to live under the wrath of God. On the wrath of God it is a conſuming fire; and who can ſtand before his wrath! <hi>If his wrath be kindled but a little,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> How doth the conſcience tormented with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion

and ſenſe of Gods wrath make men cry out and roar, and tremble and quake, and be reſtleſs, and eaſeleſs, and hopeleſs! But now Jeſus Chriſt by his blood hath reconciled us and God; he hath quenched this devouring flame of fire, he hath ſlain enmity, he hath ſaved us from wrath, from that wrath which is ſo infinitely dreadful, and which otherwiſe would have burned and conſumed us for ever, and ever, and ever; And beſides that he hath made us <hi>nigh,</hi> and hath made us one again; we may now with the <hi>Prodigal</hi> come back again unto our Fathers houſe and be kindly accepted and received, Well! If you know the Scriptures, and if you know what a juſt and wrathful God is, and if you know what a ſinning creature is, or what ſin is! Then bleſs God for Chriſt, and bleſs Chriſt for himſelf, and for his love, and for his blood, and for his death, who hath taken up the greateſt controverſie that ever was; as he took up the nature of the different parties into his own Perſon ſo he took off the differences twixt them by his own blood. Father, ſaid Chriſt. I will die, I will ſhed my blood, ſo that thou wilt be friends again with theſe poor ſinners and enemies, ſo that thou wilt pardon them, and be pacified towards them, and take them into favour again, and own them; and Chriſt did this, and God accepted of this: O love this reconciling Chriſt!</p>

To have the juſtice of God ſatisfied, to have all your ſins pardoned, to have God reconciled! If a great man and you fell out, and were at deadly variance, as he has you in his power, and might every moment of the day ſeize on you, and take away your life, and cut you in pieces, would you be quiet and contented? eſpecially when you your ſelf were the juſt cauſe of all the difference and danger, would you not ſeek peace? would you not be glad to be reconciled, eſpecially if he ſhould offer it? why, you and the great God are fallen out, and you are the cauſe of it; you ſinned againſt him, and did that which his ſoul did hate, and did him wrong, and provoked him to wrath, and his wrath is revealed againſt you, and he can (when he will) at any time, in any place lay hold on you by the hand of his power, and execute his righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on you, and deſtroy and damn you for ever! And yet will you neglect to make peace with him? will you dally in this caſe, eſpecially ſeeing he is thus far indulgent as to ſhew you the way how to take hold of him, and make peace with him! There is no way in the world for this, but by coming in to Chriſt, and receiving of him by faith; and therefore if you would indeed eſcape the wrath of God, if you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed enjoy God as appeaſedand pacified, and reconciled, then lay hold on Chriſt by faith; I ſay on Chriſt, who only is our peace, and who only can make our peace: In whom the Father is well pleaſed, and by whom he is well pleaſed with us.</p>

                     <p>1. The Privative part of Redemption is <hi>that from which we are freed by Chriſt,</hi> and that is from all the chaines of Spiritual bondage. Now there are ſix chaines <note place="margin">The Privative part, from what we are freed. From the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin.</note> of bondage with which every ſinner is bound, and from them all there is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>1. With the chaines of bondage under <hi>the power of ſin,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 19. <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame he is brought in bondage;</hi> Every ſervant of ſin is a Bond-ſlave to his Luſts; and ſo many ſinful luſts as he hath, ſo many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants doth he ſerve as a ſlave. And there is no ſlavery or bondage like unto that of ſin; for ſin never gives reſt nor wages, but is infinite in its commands, and damns us at laſt for a requital of all our ſervices: But from this bondage doth Chriſt redeem or deliver us: For <hi>this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Divel,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8. Thoſe works of the Divel were our ſins, as the ſame verſe expounds them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Our Old Man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things in ſin, from which Chriſt delivers us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

And from the <hi>damnation for ſin. There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. by his blood which juſtifies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. With the chaines of bondage <hi>under the power of Gods Juſtice:</hi> By reaſon <note place="margin">From the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> of ſin we fall into the hands of a juſt God who hath threatned ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his wrath againſt it: So that whereſoever the ſinner lives, he lives under this cloud of Gods wrath (which at any times) may break and fall down upon him, and utterly and eternally overwhelme him. This is a very dreadful bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, worſe than his who ſate eating with a great ſharp ſword hanging over his head with a little weak ſmall thread: And worſe than his who hung by a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bough, which if it brake, he had immediately fallen down, and had been daſhed in pieces upon the Rocks. But Jeſus Chriſt hath redeemed us out of the hands of Gods juſtice, by ſatisfying and appeaſing the ſame, and ſo hath delivered us from wrath. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Even Jeſus who hath delivered us from the wrath to come, we are ſaved from wrath through him.

With the chaines of bondage under the <hi>fear of death and hell:</hi> A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <note place="margin">From the fear of death.</note> fear of which lies upon the conſcience of the ſinner, who although in the preſence of his mad and wild companions, and in the midſt of his cups and delights, ſeems to be either unmindful or ſlighting; yet when he is alone, and more ſerious, his heart doth tremble at the thoughts of death and judgement; I would not die, I am afraid to die!

No, no, if God ſhould give you no more than what you deſerve, you ſhould have nothing but wrath and damnation: But though you have no right or title of your own, yet you have a right and title in and by the purchaſe of Chriſt. As a ſtranger hath no title of his own, yet if he be adopted to be a Son, upon this adoption there falls in a right or title: Or as if a poor Beggar ſhould have an eſtate of Inheritance bought for him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſetled upon him by another; he may now expect and plead for that Inheritance, It was purchaſed and bought for me. So may we now go to God, and preſs him humbly and believingly, Lord, ſhew me mercy, forgive me all my ſins, give me thy Spirit, give me eternal life; why ſaith God, who are you? and what right and title have you? and what have you to ſhew for ſuch heavenly lands and poſſeſſions! Lord, I have nothing of my own to ſhew, but yet I have the blood of Chriſt to ſhew; he bought me, and he bought all theſe at thy hands for me, it coſt him dear, even his precious blood, therefore give me theſe things for his Names ſake.</p>

                     <p>2. <hi>There is nothing which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, but it is very precious and very neceſſary:</hi> Chriſt did not dye for ſmall things; all that Chriſt hath purchaſed, he did purchaſe the ſame with his precious blood; and if all that he purchaſed is worth his blood, then ſurely it is worth our care and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                     <p>But why, is it not thus? you look on Chriſts purchaſe only in the reverſion, as if heavenly glory were the whole ſumme: It is not ſo, there are many precious things of a preſent poſſeſſion which he hath purchaſed: And why are you ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe about them! If you do indeed believe them that they are precious and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; why take you no more pains to enjoy God as your reconciled God? why do you not ſeek his favour and love which Chriſt hath purchaſed? and why are you ſo negligent to make peace with God, and to ſue out that peace which Chriſt hath made? and why do you not ſeriouſly beg for holineſs, and for all the graces of the Spirit of Chriſt? for theſe hath Chriſt purchaſed as well as glory: verily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men do not belive that Chriſt hath purchaſed any thing; and many believe only that he hath purchaſed heaven; but for all other things; they fall neither within their faith, nor within their care.</p>
                     <p>4. If you believe the meritorious purchaſe of Chriſt, why do you <hi>keep off and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why do you ſtagger in your expectations and hopes? Improve the ſufferings of Chriſt as a purchaſe.</note> 
                        <hi>ſtagger in your expectations and hopes, and confidences for glory and mercy,</hi> for any good, and doubt your enjoyments? is it not becauſe you doubt either of Chriſts title, or of your own right.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Mind and improve the ſufferings of Christ as a meritorious purchaſe:</hi> do not reſt in the ſufferings of Chriſt as a ſatisfaction only, nor as a deliverance
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55323:146"/>
only; but go on further, and conſider them as a purchaſe, and accordingly improve them.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, ponder well what I ſay.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Your eſtate is not full without the purchaſe of Chriſt, and the good things pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Your eſtate is not full with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt</note> 
                        <hi>by his blood:</hi> Suppoſe you have Gods juſtice ſatisfied for the ſins which you have committed, and ſuppoſe that Chriſt hath delivered you from wrath and condemnation: yet this is not enough that all a mans debts be paid; is this enough, unleſs you ſet him up with a good ſtock again? As deliverance from ſin, and death, and wrath is neceſſary; ſo a right unto, and a poſſeſſion of grace and glory is neceſſary: As you muſt ſhew your aquittance from miſery, ſo you muſt ſhew your title to bleſſedneſs, and this lies in the blood of Chriſt as a purchaſe: the eſtate is not full, it is not repaired, unleſſe you come to poſſeſſion again.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the eſtate is not full, ſo <hi>it is not ſafe without the enjoyment of what</hi>

                        <hi>Chriſt hath purchaſed,</hi> nor without his title for the ſame. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandements, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into the City.</hi> Heb. 12. 14 <hi>Without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Rom. 8. 30. <hi>Whom he predeſtinated, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> Heb. 10. 39. <hi>We are of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoule.</hi> Acts 11. 18. <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life!</hi> Lo, here are things purchaſed by Chriſt <hi>In ordine ad finem,</hi> holineſſe, repentance, juſtification, faith, and obedience; and without theſe there is no entring into life, &amp;c. And therefore by all means look after the purchaſe of Chriſt, this is your ſalvation and Rock to build upon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Your conſcience will never be ſatisfied elſe;</hi> it will break down your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences <note place="margin">Your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will never be ſatisfied without it.</note> from heaven if you have not Chriſt as your purchaſe; your rejoycing muſt be in Chriſt Jeſus, and your hopes in Chriſt Jeſus: And you muſt <hi>be found in him, not having your own righteouſneſſe, but the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Do you finde them <hi>within Chriſts purchaſe?</hi> If ſo, then they are <hi>within your faith,</hi> and you may take them into your Prayer, and you ſhall certainly ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>At the time of death;</hi> when all your hopes to all eternity depend on <note place="margin">At the time of death.</note> Chriſt; and when the great buſineſs and eſtate of immortality and life comes to the iſſue; and when all for ever is reduced to the merit and power of Chriſts death and purchaſe; when if Chriſt failes, all failes; and if his merit holds, heaven is ſure, and you ſouls are ſure! This is the great time, the laſt time to improve the meritorious purchaſe of Chriſt: Now lay hold on him, and faſt hold on him, on his death, on his blood; O bleſſed Jeſus! thy Perſon have I accepted, thy blood have I relyed on (on that precious and purchaſing blood) I have relied hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to on it, and it hath brought grace into my heart, and peace into my conſcience, and joy into my ſoul, and forgiveneſs of ſins, and the taſte of much mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55323:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I read, and I do believe the future inheritance purchaſed by thy blood, and reſerved in heaven for me: I die in the faith of it, I believe alſo to enjoy the Crown of Righteouſneſs, the Kingdom of glory, that eternal life which is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</p>
                     <p>6. I will ſuper-add one great benefit more which reſults from Chriſts Suffering <note place="margin">The ſuffering of Chriſt is the confirmation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> as our Mediatour, which ſhall be the cloſe of all the reſt, and that is this, <hi>The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or death, or blood of Chriſt is the confirmation of the Covenant;</hi> you read of a two-fold confirmation of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God confirmed the Covenant, and he confirmed it by an <hi>Oath,</hi> Heb. 6. 17. and Pſal. 89 35. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Jeſus Chriſt confirmed the Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. The Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt; and Jeſus Chriſt confirmed <hi>it by his Oath,</hi> therefore his blood is called the <hi>blood of the Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. And the <hi>blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> Matth. 26. 28. <note place="margin">In a two-fold reſpect. His death gives force unto it.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt confirms the Covenant in a two-fold reſpect.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>In that his death gives force unto it:</hi> To this agrees that of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16 <hi>Where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſary be the death of the Teſtator.</hi> verſe 17. <hi>For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead:</hi> In this place the Covenant is called a Teſtament, or a laſt Will, wherein Eſtates, and Legacies are bequeathed, and which cannot be challenged untill the Teſtator dies; but upon his death the Teſtament is of force (that is) all concerned in the Will and Teſtament may come, and demand, and take out the Legacies bequeathed unto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> And whereas you may object, that the Saints before the death of Chriſt obtained all bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It is anſwered, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was a Lumb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. Jeſus Chriſt was reckoned both with God, and with his Church of old as dead, and the promiſe of laying down his life for his people, accepted in their time, as if it had been performed; and his very death appeared unto them in the Sacrifices of the Law, and accordingly the Teſtament was of force unto them.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>In that his death ſeals the Covenant,</hi> as firm, and ſtable, and unalterable, <note place="margin">His death ſeals the Covenant.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Though it be but a mans Covenant, yet if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, no man diſanulleth or addeth thereto:</hi> There is now no queſtion to be made of the intentions of God, or of his promiſes in the Covenant, for they are all of them Yea, and Amen in Chriſt, they are ſure and ſtable; the blood of Chriſt hath confirmed and ratified all; there cannot poſſibly be an higher confirmation of the Covenant than this; If a man offers you his Oath to aſſure you, this is high; but if a man will lay down his life upon it, if he will take his death upon it, he cannot give an Higher Teſtimony or Confirmation unto a Truth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But will ſome ſay, What if Chriſt did die? why muſt there be thereupon a confirmation of the Covenant? muſt all the Covenant be ſure for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe Chriſt died? what was there in his death for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer; <hi>The death of Chriſt was the death of a Surety;</hi> and of one who was therefore to die, that the Covenant might be eſtabliſhed: There are three things conſiderable in the death of Chriſt: One is <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: The other is <hi>Merit</hi> of all the good which we do need and God will beſtow:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55323:147"/>
And there is alſo <hi>Efficacie;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt will ſee all made good; and in theſe reſpects his death comes to be a confirmation of the Covenant; but I will not ſtand any longer on this Point; only I will make a little Uſe of it, and ſo paſſe on.</p>

God and men, ſhould be a Mediatour alſo for damned Divels, who are eternally judged for their tranſgreſſion, or ſhould ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the Heavens and Earth, and ſuch like Creatures which were never capable of offending or ſinning againſt God! But by <hi>all things</hi> which the Apoſtle ſaith Chriſt hath Reconciled, he means the univerſal Church, which is now partly in Heaven, and partly in earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some have held that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath died for all mankind, without any difference of ſins or ſinners;</hi> that he took upon him all the ſins of all men, and did by his death expiate all their ſins, and <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> reconciled them to God without any reſpect to believing or not believing: Nay let them ſpeak out their own Opinion, Chriſt (ſay they) did ſuffer, was crucified, and died, and ſatisfied no leſs for them that are now damned, and that hereafter ſhall be damned, then for the ſins of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Saints, and all that ſhall be ſaved: This was the Opinion of <hi>Jacobus Andreas</hi> in the conference of <hi>Montpelgart,</hi> and one <hi>Haberus</hi> followed it fully: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) died not for ſome men only, but for all the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> not one man of univerſal mankind excepted (no not <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf) whether they do by faith challenge that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remain in it, or whether they do by infidelity refuſe that ſalvation, and thereupon periſh eternally: Methinks it is great pity that any were in Hell before Chriſt died, and that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſuffer ſo exceedingly for mens ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation who are already damned.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Others are of opinion that the death of Chriſt was univerſal for all men, thus far, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt as to this work, wrought Redemption for all,</hi> not only in a way <hi>of ſufficiency</hi> (which reſpects the dignity of his Perſon) but in a way of <hi>ſufficiency</hi> as to God (that is) he ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for all, and purchaſed deliverance and ſalvation for all, and if any miſſe of that ſalvation and Redemption the fault is not in Chriſt who pay'd the Ranſome for all, nor in God who accepted it for all; but only in particular mens Unbelief who refuſe Chriſt, and that univerſal ſalvation by him: So that according to this opinion the Redemption of Chriſt is univerſal on Chriſts part; and as to his work though it prove to be but particular as to the unbelievers part, all men are in a ſalvable condition, and ſhall be ſaved, if they themſelves will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Others are of Opinion that the Redemption of Chriſt hath a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; One as to the <hi>dignity of the price</hi> which he laid down, which was ſufficient in itſelf for all! Another as to the <hi>intended ſcope</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>his death,</hi> which they make commenſurable with the will and purpoſe of God, and the compact 'twixt God and Chriſt in the behalf of all the Elect of God. Now in this Opinion they hold Redemption by Chriſt in ſome reſpect to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, namely as to all the Elect of God; but yet ſo, that in reſpect of the whole world, it is only particular.</p>
                     <p>This diſtinction is the ſame in ſenſe with that of Reconciliation.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>valor, ſufficiency, or dignity of him that died.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>efficacy of it for all the Elect,</hi> and all that believe in Chriſt; and therefore the Author of the Book <hi>De vocatione gentium</hi> (whether it were <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. In this ſenſe alſo, the Death and Redemption, and ſalvation by Chriſt may be ſaid to be univerſal, or to be for all; namely <hi>That all who are Redeemed and ſaved, they are Redeemed and ſaved by Christ.</hi> As a School-maſter in a town is ſaid to teach all the Children in that town, not becauſe every Child in that town is taught by him, but becauſe every Child that is taught, he is taught by him; ſo ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Chriſt Redeems and ſaves all, not that every particular man is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and ſaved by Chriſt: but that all who are redeemed and ſaved, are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaved by him, there being no other Name but his by which we muſt be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In this ſenſe alſo you may hold it general as <hi>to the Goſpel Annuntiation</hi> (as <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſpeaks) or offer as we ſpeak; although the grace and vertue of Chriſts Redemption reacheth not unto all, yet the offer and invitation of it by the Goſpel is unto all; and therefore Chriſt in his Commiſſion unto the Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go and teath all Nations.</hi> Mark 16. 15. <hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the Goſpel to every creature;</hi> yet with this condition annexed, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned,</hi> verſe 16.</p>
                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, I deſire to give mine own judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Queſtion propoſed, in theſe three concluſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt did effectually die for all the Elect, and every one of them, whether Jews or Gentiles; and all the benefits of his death do reach unto every one of them, when they come to believe on him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there was ſuch a ſufficiency of price and redemption by Chriſt, that if any ſinner whatſoever comes by faith unto Chriſt, he ſhall receive all the benefits and fruits of redemption by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the death of Chriſt was never actually effectual for the Redemption, Reconciliation, Expiation, and ſalvation of all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and for every particular ſinner in the world. <note place="margin">Jeſus Chriſt did effectually dye for all the Elect.</note>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt did effectually die for all the Elect,</hi> and <hi>Believers:</hi> My meaning is, that he did by his death ſatisfie Gods juſtice for them, expiated their ſins, made their peace, and purchaſed ſalvation for them; and of all theſe, every Elect and Believing perſon ſhall partake. The Scriptures are expreſly clear for this aſſertion; and I do not know any modeſt and underſtanding Writer who doth gainſay it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their ſins:</hi> His people are all the Elect given unto him, and all Believers who receive him. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Chriſt is the Head of the Church, and the Saviour of the body.</hi> To whom he is a Head, of them he is a Saviour; but he is the Head

                     </p>
                     <p>I do purpoſely lay down theſe Concluſions for two Reaſons. One is to ſtop
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55323:154"/>
the clamours of evil-minded men, who give out, that if Redemption by Chriſt be not univerſal, then we ſhut the door againſt ſinners, and diſcourage them from coming unto Chriſt. Another is to encourage the hearts of all broken-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners to draw near to Chriſt, though all men are not effectually redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.</p>
                     <p>I would concerning this Point clear unto you theſe two poſitions.</p>
                     <p>1. That though effectual Redemption by Chriſt be not univerſal, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; yet this is not <hi>in the nature of it, a Doctrine to diſcourage any ſinner from coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</hi> We have familiar Similies to illuſtrate this; as that of a Race, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in though but one ſhall certainly enjoy the prize or Lawrel, yet this doth not diſcourage any one from running the Race. And as if any place be void in a Society, though only a few can be choſen and poſſeſſed of thoſe places, yet this doth not diſcourage many from ſtanding for thoſe places: So although effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Redemption by the death of Chriſt be particular, yet this diſcourageth none from looking after Chriſt, or coming by faith unto him: For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>No ſinner knows any particular excluſion of himſelf:</hi> No ſinner (at leaſt unto whom the Goſpel comes) can ſay, I am ſure that Chriſt never died for me, and I am ſure that though I ſhould cometo Chriſt, I ſhall never receive any good by him. Though the effectuall Redemption be particular, yet no ſinner knowes that he is in particular excluded from the benefit of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Goſpel gives encouragement unto every particular ſinner to come to Chriſt: Come, for all things are ready,</hi> Luke 14. It calls upon him, <hi>Come and hearken, and your ſoul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 2. And ſaith, <hi>that whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. And him <hi>that comes to me, I will in no wiſe reject,</hi> Joh 6 37. 1. The Goſpel puts no conditions of Ante-grace: 2. Or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but offers freely. 3. All former things paſſed by. 4. Complaines of unbelief.</p>
                     <p>The way which the Goſpel uſeth to bring men in to Chriſt is proper to work on any ſinner, though the benefit be peculiar to ſome: though the Goſpel doth not ſay that all ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, yet the Goſpel ſaith that all who believe ſhall be ſaved; and all who believe not ſhall be damned; <hi>Ergo.</hi> It diſcourageth none from coming to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Goſpel holds out enough for any particular ſinner to lay hold on:</hi> It holds out a ſufficiency in Chriſt for any, and offers Chriſt indefinitely. A willingneſs in Chriſt to receive any that come unto him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>It offers Jeſus Chriſt to any ſinner;</hi> yea to the vileſt and moſt wretched: To the perſecuting <hi>Paul,</hi> to the adulterous <hi>Magdalen,</hi> to the <hi>Sodomitical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1. 13. 1 Cor. 6. 19.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Any ſinner may accept the offer</hi> without any ſin; for it is <hi>worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Let any ſinner whatſoever come in by faith unto Chriſt, and he ſhall effectually partake of Redemption and ſalvation by Chriſt.</hi> Rev. 3. 20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the doore, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is a thirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> John 7. 23. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. Doe but conſider, as faith is the condition required on our part, ſo it is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition; there is no more, no other thing required to bring you in to Chriſt, nor to bring you into communion, or fellowſhip, or participation of himſelf, nor of the benefits of his death, but faith: If you do believe Chriſt is you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

2. Again, where the Goſpel is revealed unto a people; the reaſon why any of them miſs of ſalvation, and are damned, is becauſe they believe not, Joh. 3. 8. <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> ver. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Now if this be ſo, that unbelief cuts the ſinner off, that it hinders him of life by Chriſt, that it is his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that it ſeals the wrath of God on him; then certainly faith in Chriſt (in any man whatſoever) will bring him to life, to all good in and by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>That the death of Chriſt as Mediatour was not effectual for all;</hi> it was not an <note place="margin">The death of Chriſt was not effectual for all</note> univerſal effectual Redemption, Expiation, Reconciliation and Salvation for all ſinners, and for every particular ſinner.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which I would offer unto you about this Concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Proofs from Scripture, as to the Aſſertion in general.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Proofs in particular, that the Death and Redemption, and Reconciliation, &amp;c. by Chriſt, was not univerſally effectual either 1. In God the Fathers intention, nor in Chriſts intention: 2. In the real Impetration of Chriſt. 3. In the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in time unto all the ſons of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>1. I ſhall endeavour in the general to prove this Negative truth, that the death <note place="margin">In the general Proofs from Scripture.</note> of Chriſt as Mediatour was not effectual for all and every man, for Reprobates as well as Elect, for unbelievers as well as believers, for the damned as well as the ſaved. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep:</hi> Thoſe for whom Chriſt did dye, were his ſheep: But all and every man are not his ſheep; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did not die for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">As from <hi>John</hi> 10 15.</note> man: The firſt Propoſition Jeſus Chriſt delivers in this Scripture <hi>(I lay down my life for the ſheep)</hi> The ſecond Propoſition Chriſt himſelf alſo delivers in verſe 26. <hi>(But ye believed not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep.)</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> If the queſtion be put, But who are Chriſts ſheep?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Why! Chriſt alſo reſolves that Queſtion, and ſo reſolves it, that he plainly demonſtrates all are not his ſheep. See verſe 27. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</hi> verſe 28. And <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> The ſheep are deſcribed by their own property, and by Chriſts bounty and care. They are Chriſts ſheep, who <hi>do hear Chriſts voice,</hi> and ſo hear his voice <hi>that they follow him,:</hi> But all and every man doth not the one nor the other: again, Chriſt ſayes, <hi>I give unto my ſheep eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> Doth Chriſt give unto every one in the world eternal life? and ſhall not any one in all the worldperiſh! why then doth the Scripture ſay, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. <hi>And we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoul;</hi> Heb. 10. 39.

                     <p>There are two ſhifts which are made inſtead of anſwers unto this Scripture.</p>
                     <p>1. One is that of <hi>Haberus,</hi> That all men are ſheep; he muſt mean the ſheep of Chriſt, or elſe he anſwers nothing: But this Chriſt himſelf as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>There are but two reſpects upon which men may be called the ſheep of God, or of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>One is in <hi>reſpect of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

2. Another is that of the Remonſtrants, who ſaid that Chriſt did lay down his life for the ſheep, but it is not ſaid for <hi>the ſheep only,</hi> for them alone: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a ſhift much like that of the Papiſts, who when we preſſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for juſtification only by faith, they ſay the word [only by faith] is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; unto whom we reply, that vertually it is; for the Scripture oppoſeth Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, unto juſtification by works; and denying it unto works, therefore it aſcribes juſtification only to Faith: And verily thus it holds as to the preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute; Chriſt died for his ſheep; if for none but his ſheep, than for them only: when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou haſt given me,</hi> Joh. 17. 9. This is as much as if he had ſaid, I pray only for them whom thou haſt given me. So when Chriſt ſaith, I lay down my life for my ſheep, and afterwards ſo deſcribes his ſheep, that all unbelievers are none of the ſheep for whom he died: now it will follow that he died only for his ſheep: And indeed I would fain know for whom Chriſt ſhould die for beſides his ſheep? ſhould he die for them who were never given unto him? of whom he never took care? to whom he never was a Shepherd? for them that were never a part of his flock, and charge? Is this the commendations of of a good Shepherd, to lay down his life for ſuch as have no Relation at all unto him, nor he unto them?</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> But it is ſaid that Chriſt <hi>died for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5. 6.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 'Tis true, yet not for all the ungodly; for thoſe who are made his ſheep by grace, were indeed in themſelves ungodly ſinners; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So though no particular Believer can appropriate the death and vertues of the death of Chriſt unto himſelf in excluſion of any other Believer (who are all mentioned in the Will and Teſtament of Chriſt) yet all Believers (who are the ſheep of Chriſt) can ſay that Chriſt hath died for us, and hath purchaſed, and left the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us only, none other being mentioned in his Teſtament, nay, all unbl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Third Scripture which I would make uſe of againſt the Univerſal effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſts death, for all and every man, ſhall be that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32, 33, 34. Verſe 33. <hi>He that spared not his own Sonne, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo give us all things?</hi> Verſe 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth;</hi> Verſe 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died; yea, rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi> Verſe 35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Christ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This place affords unto us many conſiderable paſſages.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A delivering up of Chriſt to death for all the Elect and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God <hi>(Pro Nobis omnibus)</hi> not ſimply for all, but for us all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A certainty of enjoyment of all things; of all the good things which God the Father hath promiſed, and God the Son hath purchaſed for all them for whoſe ſake Jeſus Chriſt was delivered up (How ſhall he not with him alſo give us all things?) As if he had ſaid, God having given his Chriſt for you, will certainly give you all other things with Chriſt; if he gives the greater, he will not ſtand with you for the leſs; whatſoever good you need, you ſhall aſſuredly poſſeſs and enjoy it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the death of Chriſt is effectual for the abſolution of all thoſe for whom Chriſt was delivered up. It is effectual againſt any thing that can be brought in againſt them <hi>(who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth)</hi> And it is effectual againſt all condemnation; <hi>there is none to condemn them!</hi> if any one, it muſt be God; but he hath juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; if for any thing, it muſt be for ſinne. But ſaith the Apoſtle, It is Chriſt that died, who by his Death hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God, and hath put away ſinne (Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that Died.)</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is a Connexion 'twixt the Death of Chriſt, and the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the Seſſion of Chriſt at the right hand of God, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt; thoſe for whom Chriſt did Dye, for them he did riſe; and thoſe for whom he died, and roſe, for them (that is) for their good, He now ſits at the right hand of God, for them alſo he makes Interceſſion. And one thing more; from the love of Chriſt ſhall none of thoſe be ſeparated, for whom he dyed, and roſe again, and aſcended, and makes Interceſſion: Now how all this can be affirmed of all and every man in the world, that ever was, is, or ſhall be, is a conceit beyond any ſolid reaſon of man, or faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to reach.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Can all and every man be aſſured, or aſſure himſelf, becauſe Chriſt was delivered to death, therefore God will unqueſtionably deliver, or give him all things?</p>

                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What God intended, that he Willed and Decreed</hi> (this I think no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chriſtian will or can deny) but God never willed a General Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Reconciliation, and Salvation, by the death of Chriſt; which I prove thus; If he did will and decree it, then that Decree was either abſolute or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; if it were an <hi>abſolute</hi> Decree or Will, then it is effecual; for no man hath reſiſted that Will, which is an infallible cauſe of all which it doth will; and then all and every man ſhall actually partake of Salvation by Chriſt; which aſſertion as the Scriptures do manifeſtly contradict, ſo the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> and their followers profeſſedly deny. If it be a <hi>Conditional</hi> Will in God (as they ſay it is, in caſe of believing on Chriſt) then it is but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, of ſome men, and not univerſal, of all men; for all men have not Faith; nay, (comparatively) very few have Faith. <hi>Who hath believed our report? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom is the arme of the Lord Revealed?</hi> Iſa. 53. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If God did really intend the Redemption and Salvation of all and every man effectually by Chriſt, <hi>then he did intend, and in time did beſtow all the means which might effectually bring all and every man to the participation of that ſalvation by Chriſt</hi> (for every Agent who really and ſeriouſly intends an end, he doth likewiſe as really intend the means effectually conducing unto that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55323:157"/>
end. And as it doth not beſeem the Wiſdom of God to intend an end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes; ſo neither doth it ſuit with the goodneſs and love of God, to pretend a common ſalvation for all, when yet he intends not to give meanes unto all, effectual to bring them unto that ſalvation. But God doth not give means effectual unto all and every man, to bring them to ſalvation by Chriſt, which I thus demonſtate; The means neceſſary to an effectual participation of ſalvation by Chriſt, are</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Outwardly;</hi> the <hi>preaching of the Gospel,</hi> which is therefore called the <hi>Power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. for <hi>therein is revealed the righteouſneſſe of God from Faith to Faith,</hi> Verſe 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Inwardly;</hi> the <hi>Grace of Faith</hi> by which we are brought in to Chriſt, and made one with him, and ſo partaking of him, we come to partake of life and ſalvation by him. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith.</hi> And Mark 16. 16. <hi>He that believes, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> And 1 John 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath life.</hi> But now God doth not give unto all and every man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe means.</p>
                     <p>1. The Goſpel (which is the means of Faith) is not given unto all. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 147. 19. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgements unto Iſrael.</hi> Verſe 20. <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with every Nation, and as for his judgements they have not known them.</hi> Act. 14. 16. <hi>Who in times past, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all Nations to walk in their own wayes.</hi> And we know it by experience, that the Goſpel hath not been, and is not Preached unto all. And if it be not Preached unto all and every one, how can we rationally fancy an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God to ſave all by Chriſt? Suppoſe a Phyſician ſhould give out, that he had a medicine to cure all diſeaſes, and that he would impart it unto all, that ſo all and every one may be cured by it; nevertheleſs he doth indeed make it known but unto a few, that he hath provided that remedy or medicine; you would certainly conclude that he never intended that every one ſhould be the better for it, ſeeing he will not communicate the knowledge of it unto them; If he will not give them the knowledge of it, doth he intend to give them the benefit of it? Or ſuppoſe a potent Prince ſhould ſay, He had provided a Maſs of money to Redeem all Captives and Slaves, and that it is his ſerious intention (by that provided Treaſure) to Redeem and Free them all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one; yet nevertheleſs he never gives notice of his intention and kindneſs, unto all of them by himſelf, or any Meſſenger from himſelf; queſtionleſs he doth not intend it: For men to Print, and Preach, and Diſpute, that God intends to ſave all by Chriſt, and that he gave Chriſt to be an Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to ſet all men free, &amp;c. And yet we finde both in Scripture, and in Experience, that God doth not give the Goſpel unto all (which is the Meſſenger bringing glad tydings and reports of Chriſts death, and Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention touching the Salvation of ſinners) but ſuffer them to live in darkneſs and ſilence; not any one Meſſenger being diſpatched to report to them, and to their children, any one Word of Chriſt, or Salvation by him; This cannot ſtand with ſuch a ſerious intention in God, to Redeem and Save all men by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection,</hi> O but the Goſpel was revealed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſo down to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and by them promulgated to all the world, to all Nations, to every creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> We grant the knowledge of Salvation by Chriſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; in <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family, in the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> that came from him: But what is this to all the reſt of the world, whom God left to themſelves, and did not make the Goſpel of Salvation by Chriſt known?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55323:157"/>
And as for the <hi>Apostles,</hi> their Commiſſion was general, and they did in their times make the ſound of the Goſpel to be heard in moſt part of the world; but what is this to the ſucceeding generations of men in all the world who never heard of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor <hi>Noah,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor his Apoſtle, nor Goſpel of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>If God did intend to ſave all men in all generations by Chriſt, ſurely he would have revealed the Goſpel to all men in all generations; If his intention were ſo rich in goodneſſe unto them all, his care and Providence would have been manifeſted unto them all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps the reaſon why the Goſpel did not deſcend in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal manifeſtation of Salvation by Chriſt unto all ſucceeding generations, might be the ingratitude and unbelief of thoſe to whom it was firſt revealed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Perhaps many of them were unthankful and unbelieving; but if the knowledge and notice of ſalvation by Chriſt muſt preſently fail the poſterities of men, becauſe of the unthankfulneſſe and unbelief of Parents and Predeceſſors, then it ſeems that the latitude of the Goſpels publication depends on the will of man, and not on the will and goodneſs of God, whoſe intention to publiſh this univerſal Redemption and ſalvation unto all is ſtayed and altered upon the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and refuſal of Chriſt, and ſo for their ſakes there muſt not be now a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to ſucceeding generations who never heard, and therefore never refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>2. As the Goſpel is not univerſally given to all, ſo neither is <hi>Faith univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given unto all; for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. If therefore the hearing be not univerſal, then unqueſtioanably faith cannot be univerſal; and if faith be not univerſal, then there cannot be an univerſal participation of Redemption and Salvation by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be replyed; though faith be not univerſal as to every mans poſſeſſion, yet it is univerſal as to Gods intention; he intended for his part, and as much as concerns him to give faith to all and every man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, thi, is not true:</p>
                     <p>For if God intends to give faith unto all and every ſinner as will put forth ſo much towards it as concerns him, then every ſinner ſhall undoubtedly have faith given unto him, becauſe as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8 If God will give a man faith, he ſhall have it; for there is no gift which God will give, but he hath power to make it his to whom he will give it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But men will not receive it, though God will give it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> God doth not give faith upon that condition, if man will have it; this is an offer, not a gift. But God (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13.) <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> To give us a will to believe and come to Chriſt, this is Gods work; and therefore if God will work (towards faith) as much as concerns him, he muſt remove our unwillingneſs and make us willing.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The giving of faith is commenſurable with the election of God</hi> (ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed)</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the fruit and effect thereof, and therefore it is called the <hi>faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Tit. 1. 1. and ſtands as a neceſſary means in the way of participation of all our ſaving good unto which we are elected, and which was purchaſed for us by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>3. A third Argument that God did not intend ſuch an univerſal Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt, is this; <hi>If God had intended ſuch an univerſal work and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit for all men by Christ; Then he would have given all men to Chriſt</hi> for ſuch an end and purpoſe as their Redemption and ſalvation by him (for if God wold never
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55323:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give them to Chriſt, we may well ſuſpect that he never intended to ſave them by Chriſt; if they muſt not belong to the Saviour and Redeemer, then Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation ſhall never belong to them. But God did not give all and every nan to Chriſt; neither <hi>ex parte tituli,</hi> ſo that he ſhould acknowledge them as given unto him by the Father, nor <hi>ex parte debiti,</hi> nor <hi>ex parte Rei,</hi> that he ſhould ſtand charged and bound fot their Redemption and Salvation: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That all were not <hi>diſcriminatim</hi> given by God the Father unto Chriſt <hi>ratione ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli</hi> is manifeſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy word.</hi> And verſe 10. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</hi> Nor <hi>ex parte Rei.</hi> Joh. 6. 37. <hi>All that the Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, ſhall come unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here you ſee,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That thoſe who were given unto Chriſt, they were given out of the world, not all the world, but ſome out of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they who were given unto Chriſt, God the Father had firſt a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt in them <hi>(thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me)</hi> but all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever never had ſuch a particular Relation to God, nor God to them, as that it can be ſaid, Thine they were.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe that were given to Chriſt, he ſaith of them, <hi>they have kept thy word,</hi> verſe 6. and <hi>have received thy words,</hi> verſe 8. and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me; Can this be ſaid of all and every man? Nor doth Chriſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or own all men whatſoever as given to him. verſe 9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou haſt given me, for they are thine:</hi> and verſe 10. <hi>All mine are thine, and mine are thine.</hi> Neither were all given to Chriſt <hi>ratione debiti,</hi> that he ſhould ſtand charged and bound for their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> Here is the extent of his Commiſſion and Charge which he is bound to make good, and that is to give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him <hi>(i.)</hi> effectually to ſave all them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I will add but one Argument more to prove that God intended not an univerſal Redemption and Salvation by the death of Chriſt; and that ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> verſe 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with long-ſuffering the veſsels of wrath fitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction!</hi> verſe 23. <hi>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.</hi> The Apoſtle in this place doth purpoſely handle the doctrine of Election and Preterition; that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he proves to be particular, and not univerſal; this he doth by inſtance, and by Reaſon: The <hi>inſtance</hi> is given in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> God loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> but he hated <hi>Eſau;</hi> ver. 13. The <hi>reaſon</hi> of this ſpeciality of love in <hi>Election</hi> he preſents in verſe 15. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy;</hi> and verſe 18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will, he hardneth.</hi> That God ſhould love one, and hate another; chuſe one, and paſſe by another; ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſome, and leave others to be hardned; the reaſon of this is, his own will; he will love whom he we will love, and elect whom he will elect, and ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to whom he will ſhew mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Now whereas ſome murmuringly reply againſt God for ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular love, and election, and purpoſe of mercy, as if God dealt not fairly in it, thus differently to deal with his Creatures, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The Apoſtle defends this proceeding of God in the authority which he hath for it, ver. 21. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay of the ſame lump to make one veſſel of wrath fitted for deſtruction,</hi> verſe 22. <hi>and to magnifie the riches of his glory</hi> of his grace <hi>on the veſſels of mercy afore prepared unto glory?</hi> verſe 23. By
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55323:158"/>
all which it manifeſtly appears that there are ſome whom God never loved, but hated; whom he never elected, but paſſed by; whom he intended not to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto, but to leave them to be hardned; that he would not make them veſſels to honour, but to diſhonour; that were veſſels not of mercy aforehand prepared to glory, but veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction; which if it be ſo (and ſo the Apoſtle ſaith it is) then undoubtedly God did never intend an univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and univerſal purchaſe of peace and mercy and ſalvation by Chriſt, for all and every man: For by <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine he doth not intend to ſhew mercy to the veſſels of wrath; and yet by the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, he doth intend to ſhew mercy to all.</p>
                     <p>2. I now proceed to the ſecond Concluſion; As God the Father never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <note place="margin">Chriſt did not intend ſuch a latitude for all by his death.</note> an univerſal Redemption and Jubile by the death of Chriſt: So <hi>neither did Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God (who did die to ſave ſinners) intend ſuch a latitude for all and every man.</hi> The intention and minde of Chriſt in this, I <note place="margin">Proved.</note> humbly conceive cannot be better diſcerned than by</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The entring into his Office of Mediatorſhip as a Surety.</item>
                        <item>2. The opening of his laſt Will and Teſtament, when he was near death to ſeal it.</item>
                        <item>3. The proſecuting of all their intereſts who were concerned in him, and his death.</item>
                        <item>4. The diſowning of ſome, as ſuch as he never had reſpect unto.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>When Chriſt entred into, or took on himſelf the office of a Mediator,</hi> he then <hi>declared himſelf alſo a Surety or Sponſor.</hi> Therefore as he is ſtiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. The <hi>Mediatour of the New Covenant;</hi> ſo is he ſaid to be made the <hi>Surety of a better Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 7. 22.</p>
                     <p>The Argument runs thus; Jeſus Chriſt is a Surety for all thoſe to whom he is a Mediatour, Redeemer, and Saviour. But he never was a Surety for all, and every man. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe Propoſitions cannot be denied; for the Scripture calls Chriſt our Mediatour, and Redeemer, our Surety, and ſaith expreſly, that <hi>Chriſt once ſuffered for ſinners, the Juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>(i.)</hi> in their ſtead, and for their good, and <hi>that he bare our diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>carried our ſoroows, and the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him; and our iniquities were laid upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>But then for the ſecond Propoſition that he never was a Surety for all and every man. Will the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſpeak plainly to this? was he, or was he not? If he were not, then every ſinfull mans debts are not paid by Chriſt, and then every man is not redeemed, and then God is not reconciled to every man; for if that debt be not paid, and God ſatisfied, then Redemption is not wrought, &amp;c. If he was a Surety for all and every man, then Jeſus Chriſt put himſelf in the room and ſtead of every ſinner of the world, as a ſurety doth for every one to whom he is a Surety, and bound himſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>f as reſponſible to Divine Juſtice to ſatisfie all that could be charged againſt any ſinner, as the ſurety doth for every one he ſtands bound for: I <hi>will be ſurety for him, ſaid Judah</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi> about <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 43. 9. <hi>Of my hand ſhalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and ſet him before thee, let me bear the blame for ever.</hi> So Jeſus Chriſt as Surety to God, did actually ſatisfie the Juſtice of God the Father for us, and pay, and diſcharge all the debt; ſo that wrath, and curſe, and damnation are utterly removed, and can never befall the ſinner, becauſe Chriſt as a Surety hath perfectly ſatisfied for all, and cleared all; <hi>Sed ira Dei manet infidelibus,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. Nay as a Surety he did not only ſatisfie to the diſcharging of all ſin and puniſhment, but merited alſo and purchaſed mercy life, grace, and glory; and God is bound to give in all this; So that if Chriſt be a Surety for all and every man, and as a Surety died for them all, then is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55323:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gods Juſtice fully ſatisfied, God hath no more to ſay againſt any ſinner; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not damn any (becauſe all ſin is ſatisfied for, and diſcharged) and every man ſhall certainly be ſaved, becauſe Chriſt as a Surety hath purchaſed this, and muſt, and will ſee it performed and enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>But this no <hi>Arminian</hi> that ever I read or heard of, will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, we may find out the very mind of Chriſt concerning the latitude of Redemption and ſalvation by his death, if we peruſe his <hi>laſt will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> where his mind is plainly opened unto us, and which he ſealed and confirmed by his death; there you read for whom he died, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Mar. 14. 24. <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many.</hi> Luke 22. 20. <hi>This cup is the New Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> Heb. 9. 15. <hi>For this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, that by means of death for the Redemption of the tranſgreſſors that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt did not proſecute an univerſal intereſt of all the world, but a particular intereſt of ſome. Ergo.</hi> He did not intend an univerſal Redemption and Salvation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>I pray for them; I pay not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> Doubtleſſe, if Chriſt did intend to redeem and ſave all, he would have done ſo much as to have paid for all: It is ſtrange that he ſhould lay down his life for all, and yet would not lay out a prayer for all; that he would die to ſave them, and yet not pray to ſave them; if Chriſt would not do ſo much as to proſecute their ſalvation by a Prayer, I verily believe he never intended their ſalvation by his death.</p>

                        <hi>Ob.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> to decline the edge of this Argument, tell us of a double interceding or praying of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>One is particular, and this indeed is onely for Believers.</p>
                     <p>Another is univerſal, and this is for the whole world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> A handſome evaſion I confeſs; methinks they ſhould alſo diſtinguiſh of a two-fold death, and Redemption, and ſalvation by Chriſt; one particular for all believers; and another univerſal for all the world; that effectual and doing good; this ineffectual, and profiting none.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But may we know any Scriptures for Chriſts univerſal Praying, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion? yes, they quote <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> True, here is Chriſts Prayer indeed, but yet here is not the univerſal prayer for the whole world: here is his prayer for them that Crucified him out of ignorance; and we hear of the fruit of this prayer in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 17. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 4. theſe men who through ignorance crucified Chriſt, and for whom Chriſt prayed, <hi>Pater Remitte,</hi> they were not the whole world; this place therefore will not make out an univerſal interceding or praying for the whole world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Therefore they bring another Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>He made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for trannſgreſsors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 'Tis true, he made interceſſion for tranſgreſſors; but where is that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion which he made for all transgreſſors? where is the univerſal interceſſion?
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55323:159"/>
the tranſgreſſors for whom he made interceſſion in this 12. verſe, are thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which he calls many, and juſtified them in the 11. verſe.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, Jeſus Chriſt doth profeſſedly diſown ſome, as being ſuch that he never had any affection or reſpect unto; did he ever intend to dye for theſe, and to do as much for their ſalvation, as for the ſalvation of others? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out Divels, and in thy Name done many wonderful works?</hi> verſe 23. <hi>And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you; depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many ſhall ſay, and yet Chriſt will ſay to thoſe many, I never knew. He doth not ſay, I do not now know, or own you, or I did once know you: but I never knew you: Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>know his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 14. <hi>for whom he laid down his life,</hi> verſe 15. But there are many to whom Chriſt will ſay, I never knew you, never acknowledged you, never loved you, never liked you; no not when they Prophecied, and wrought miracles in his Name. Chriſt will not then know them, becauſe they rejected him, and were wicked workers, yet I never knew you.</p>
                     <p>There you ſee that this univerſal redemption cannot finde foundation either in the intention of God the Father, or in the intention of God the Son (and as Chriſt) who wrought Redemption for ſinners.</p>
                     <p>3. I ſhall now advance to a third Concluſion, <hi>that there was not an univerſal impetration of reconciliation, and remiſſion of ſins, and of eternal life by the death of Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>Before I preſent you ſome Arguments againſt this Opinion, I ſhall crave your favour that I may ſpread the whole ſumme and frame of it, as it is by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> themſelves ſet forth in their writings; they teach</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That upon the fall of mankind, in <hi>Adam,</hi> there was a gracious affection in God, by which he was yet mercifully affected to love all and every man (alike) ſo as ſeriouſly to deſire the ſalvation of all men, and of every particular man, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nullus omnino homo ſit, cujus ſalutem non velit;</hi> ſo that there was not any one man, whoſe ſalvation God did not will.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That for the extending of this favour unto all and every man, Jeſus Chriſt was ſent into the word to dye, that by his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ath, God juſtice might be ſatisfied for all the ſins of all men, and that thereupon God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> might (without any prejudice to his juſtice) <hi>Plenario voluntatis propoſito velle ſalvare,</hi> with a full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That Jeſus Chriſt did come into the world, and by his death did ſatisfie the juſtice of God; and ſo opened a door of grace for a poſſible ſalvation for all and every ſinner: Mercy now being ſet at liberty, which before was bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That all and every ſinner hath a liberty of freedom to enter into that door of grace, and beſides that, there is ſo much ſufficiency of help afforded unto them, that if their free-will be pleaſed to make uſe of it, they may
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55323:160"/>
accept of it if they will; and if they will not, it is their own fault.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. That nevertheleſſe you muſt diſtinguiſh of the death of Chriſt according to a two-fold decree of God, as they ſay there is</p>
                     <p>One Decree which is according to his affection or will deſiring to ſave all and in reſpect of this, the death of Chriſt was an univerſal impetration <hi>(i. e.)</hi> it did work ſo far in relation to God, that he might without any injury to himſelf, will an univerſal ſalvation to all men, and accordingly he did will and decree it, Chriſt having impetrated it.</p>
                     <p>Another Decree of God by which he intended the actual beſtowing, giving, and communicating of this ſalvation univerſally purchaſed by the death of Chriſt (which they and we do call the Application of the death of Chriſt) and this they ſay is <hi>Solis fidelibus,</hi> only to Believers, who by faith do receive Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So that if you demand of the Patrons of univerſal Redemption, Did God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſire and will the ſalvation of all loſt ſinners? they anſwer, he did: But did God ſeriouſly will this? yes, he did: And was Chriſt ſent for this end? he was: And did Chriſt by his death procure and obtain this for all? yes he did: But did God ever decree, or will that all and every man ſhould have benefit by this? No verily, but only Believers, only ſuch as ſuffer themſelves to believe, and repent; theſe actually are reconciled, pardoned, and ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, Jeſus Chriſt did by his death obtain this for all; Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, univerſal Remiſſion, univerſal Salvation are purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, although ſome only ſhall partake of it: All have a right in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation purchaſed, though only Believers have the benefit; nay, though no man ſhould ever believe, yet there was an univerſal ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt for all men.</p>
                     <p>Though that Aſſertion, that all Believers, and they only partake of actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and Remiſſion, and Salvation by Chriſt, be a truth, which we all agree in; yet that there is ſuch an univerſal Reconciliation, Remiſſion, and Salvation purchaſed by the death of Chriſt for all men whatſoever, is an opinion unto which we cannot ſubſcribe, but muſt reject as oppoſite unto Scripture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall let paſſe ſome Arguments which ſome make uſe of againſt this Opinion, <note place="margin">Arguments againſt this Opinion.</note> verſe 9.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some were in Hell when Jeſus Chriſt died; Did Chriſt obtain Reconciliation, and Remiſſion of ſins, and Eternal life for them? If not for them, how then for all and every man? But did God ever intend it for them, or accepted of the death of Chriſt for them? thoſe for whom Chriſt laid down his life, he ſaith of them <hi>that they ſhall never periſh,</hi> Joh. 10. 15, 28. Do not they periſh who are in hell?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How comes it to paſſe that many miſſe of heaven, who yet never refuſed or rejected Chriſt? If Chriſt obtained ſalvation for all, and theirs it is if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it not; how come they to miſſe of that obtained ſalvation? Miſſe they ſhall not (lay the <hi>Arminians)</hi> unleſſe, and untill they refuſe; but refuſe (ſay we) they cannot unleſs it be offered; and offered it is not but by the Goſpel; and the Goſpel offers it not where it comes not; but in all tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s and ages of men, it comes not to all and every man; yea, that there were any inhabitants in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> was for many Ages utterly unknown to the Chriſtian world, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are ſome whom God never elected, but paſſed them by, he would not ſhew mercy unto them; he intended to manifeſt his juſtice and wrath on thoſe veſſels of wrath; did Chriſt obtain for theſe alſo, Reconciliation, Remiſſion, and eternal life! He knew that his Father would never have mercy on them, and his death was according to the Counſel of his Father; and did his Father
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55323:160"/>
Counſel and Decree and appoint him to purchaſe and procure mercy for thoſe of whom he ſaid, he would never ſhew mercy to them? why? this were ſtrange indeed, that God ſhould put the ſoule of Chriſt to grief, and make him to bear wrath and ſorrow for them, unto whom he never intended mercy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Should not all men in the world be born in a ſtate of grace and favour? For Chriſt hath obtained Reconciliation for them all, and that Reconciliation is not forfeited untill they reject it by unbelief, and that cannot be as ſoon as they be born? How then can we all be ſaid <hi>by nature to be the children of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath is off and ceaſed when God is reconciled?</p>
                     <p>This Inference cannot poſſibly be avoided, unleſs we will fancy that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation purchaſed by Chriſt, is kept by God (as it were) in Banco, as a Treaſure which diſchargeth nothing for a while, untill hereafter it be brought forth to help a perſon upon occaſion; ſo that the Reconciliation and Remiſſion purchaſed by Chriſt, muſt he as a dead ſtock in heaven ſo long, untill men come to years, and then God makes experiments whether ſinners will make uſe of it or no, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But to theſe I ſhall add other Arguments.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Impetration of univerſal Reconciliation,</hi> either it was an <hi>actual Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> and Remiſſion, or <hi>only Potential,</hi> a Reconcileableneſs, or Remiſſable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If it were an actual Reconciliation and Remiſſion, then are God and all ſinners enemies no longer, but friends; and then every ſinner ſhall certainly be ſaved. And is a bleſſed man, for <hi>if we be reconciled by the death of Chriſt, much more ſhall we be ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Rom. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.</hi> verſe 8. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin:</hi> But this I ſuppoſe none will preſume to maintain, <hi>Ergo.</hi> no Actual Reconciliation and Remiſſion for all. If the Reconciliation and Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be only <hi>Potential,</hi> and not Actual; then</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Why doth the Scripture take no notice of this at all: But where it ſpeaks of the death of Chriſt, and Reconciliation, and Remiſſion thereby, it perpetually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the one and the other as <hi>Actual.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 13. <hi>Ye are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> verſe 14. <hi>He is our peace.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>Making peace.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>Having ſlain the enmity thereby.</hi> Col. 1. 20. <hi>Having made peace through the blood of his Croſſe.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>you hath he reconciled.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them:</hi> was all this (here aſcribed unto the death of Chriſt) only a power accruing unto God that he might (if he would) make an offer of an univerſal reconciliation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But again, Jeſus Chriſt did make an <hi>actual offering of himſelf,</hi> and he did actually ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for all (according to the Opinion of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians)</hi> Now if the Juſtice of God be actually ſatisfied, ſurely there is more than a meer power and liberty acquired that God may be reconciled to us if he will, and pardon us if he will, and ſave us if he will: Becauſe the ſatisfaction of Chriſt can and doth Oblige God to this; God having Covenanted with him, if that he would lay down his life for ſinners, that then his Righteouſneſs ſhould juſtifie and reconcile them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What we are to believe, that is true, but we are to believe that God is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reconciled by the blood of Chriſt, and hath actually forgiven us?</p>
                     <p>2. This <hi>Grand univerſal Impetration, either God intends the real actual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, or he doth never intend to apply it to all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It were moſt ſtrange that the Son of God ſhould come down from heaven, be made man, be made obedient to the death, even to the death of the Croſs; yea and be made a curſe for us, and by his blood purchaſe (as they ſay) Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55323:161"/>
and Remiſſion, and life Eternal for all and every one, if God intended not actually to beſtow theſe.</p>
                     <p>But I demand, Did he intend and will the actual collation of theſe purchaſed benefits on all and every one; or did he not?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> to this, expreſly anſwer two things. <note place="margin">Grevencovius Cortivus.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Deum nec voluiſſe, nec noluiſſe;</hi> God did neither will and intend it; neither did he nill, or not intend it:</p>
                     <p>Why then there is a Chriſt given to death, given for a Sacrifice to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for ſinners, to be a Redemption for all and every ſinner, to ſave all, and yet after all this, God is not peremptorily reſolved (either way) of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this to any one ſinner whatſoever: And ſo the death of Chriſt may be in vain, in reſpect of benefit, to all the ſinners in the world.</p>
                     <p>For although his death did ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, and thereby God gained ſo much as that he might univerſally tender Redemption to all; yet if there were no actual purpoſe, or real intention in God to beſtow this on any, who can ſay that he ſhall be the better for that which God really intends not to beſtow on him?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, they ſay that though God did not peremptorily intend to confer and beſtow this upon all, yet <hi>conditionally</hi> he did, if ſo be that all will believe on Chriſt: unto which I would reply two things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God did know that all men would not believe on Chriſt; and therefore as to the preſcience of God, this condition was not univerſal but particular; if Gods intention to impart the benefits of the death of Chriſt had a reſpect unto, and foundation in a condition which he certainly foreſaw to be particular only; Hence it will neceſſarily follow, That God never intended a Redemption and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for all: From the Argument either to God, or unto men, it ſhall bind the Adverſary.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>to God</hi> in reſpect <hi>of his intention,</hi> then thus I frame it: God intended ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, only for all who will believe in Chriſt; but God did certainly know that all men would not believe in Chriſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi> he did not intend it for all.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>to men</hi> in reſpect <hi>of the event,</hi> then thus: Salvation is obtained for all who will believe on Chriſt; but all men will not believe in Chriſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Salvation is not obtained for all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I reply to that Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That God did intend to confer or apply all ſaving benefits purchaſed by Chriſt, upon the condition that all men would believe. Either God did really intend to give this condition to all <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to work ſo effectually upon all, that they might believe through his grace; or he did not ſo intend to work on them: If he did not intend effectually to give faith unto all men, then queſtionleſſe he never did intend that all men either ſhould or could partake of that univerſal redemption by Chriſt; for no man either doth, or can partake thereof without faith; and of that faith no man neither doth, or can partake thereof, unleſs God be pleaſed to give it unto him; Faith being the gift of God. If he did intend effectually to give faith unto all men, then all men have been, are, or ſhall be Believers; for what God will effectually give, of that ſhall we partake, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> God intends to give faith to all men; but it is in his own congruous way, unto which all men ſubmit not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But this comes not home to the Argument; for I do not argue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity and fitneſs of wayes to work faith, and whether men may reſiſt theſe wayes or not; or whether God will give ſaith upon another condition, if they will have faith. This I inſiſt upon, that if God intends effectually to give faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, then all ſhall eventually have that faith: To give ſaith effectually is not a meere command to believe; nor is it to preſent unto ſinners <hi>media ſufficientia</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:55323:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
only, but it is by the Almighty operation of the Spirit of God to create and work in, or infuſe the grace of faith into the heart of a ſinner.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>If there were ſuch an univerſal Impetration of Reconciliation, andremiſſion, and ſalvation for all and every man by the death of Chriſt; then the love of God, and the love of Chriſt are of equal reſpect to all alike:</hi> All are alike in the love and intention of God who gave Chriſt; and all are alike in the love and death of Chriſt; who upon one and the ſame account died alike for all, whether believers, or unbelievers, whether thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, or thoſe that ſhall be damned; there was no difference, and no inequality of love towards ſinners; God did not look more on one than on another; neither did Chriſt regard one more than another in his death. But that any one ſpeeds better than another, this depends on himſelf, becauſe he will believe, the other will not, but all are alike objects of the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love with God and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> bluſh not to ſay that thus it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods love in the giving of Chriſt, and Chriſts love in giving himſelf (Antecedently) was alike to all, (no more to <hi>Peter</hi> than to <hi>Judas,</hi> and as much to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as to <hi>Moſes)</hi> though the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent love indeed (after men do believe) is not alike: But for the Antecedent love, that was alike to all: and the death of Chriſt was the effect of that his great and equal love unto all Antecedently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But this is a grand miſtake and Error, and that I ſhall briefly demonſtrate by Scripture and Reaſons. The Antecedent love not alike to all, appears by <note place="margin">The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love not alike to all; Proved. By Scripture.</note> theſe Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>The matter of which Chriſt there diſcourſeth, was the Myſtery of Redemption and Doctrine of ſalvation; this ſame, Chriſt ſaith that his Father <hi>did hide from the wiſe and prudent,</hi> and ſo he did, becauſe <hi>it ſeemed good unto him</hi> ſo to do: And for this differential pleaſure and work of God, Chriſt gives <hi>thanks</hi> unto his Father: Now if God did love all alike, ſo as to will all their ſalvation alike, why would he have hid the Doctrine and way of ſalvation from any? and had the love of Chriſt been alike to all in the deſire and purpoſe of their ſalvation, would he have thanked and bleſſed his Father, for hiding and not revealing of that univerſal ſalvation?</p>
                     <p>Can any man reaſonably make Chriſt thus to expreſſe himſelf?

                     <p n="2">II. I will give you another place againſt this equal love of God to all, which I believe is unanſwerable; Rom. 9. 11. <hi>The children being not yet born, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having done good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to Election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth;</hi> verſe 12. <hi>it was ſaid unto her, The</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> be Examples or Types, it matters not much to the Point in hand; here it is ſaid, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> and <hi>Eſau have I hated.</hi> Is this a love alike to both? Nor will that diſtinction of a conſequent love of God, which they make to be after faith and repentance, and to be unlike to men; or of an Antecedent love of God which is before faith and repentance, and is alike to all; I ſay this diſtinction failes them here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> For the Apoſtle ſpeaks of that Antecedent love, which yet is not alike to all <hi>(The children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil,</hi> yet <hi>Jacob have I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but Eſau have I hated.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. If the love of God and Chriſt were Antecedently alike to all men in this buſineſs of univerſal ſalvation; <hi>Then when Chriſt died for all ſinners, he loved them all with ſuch a love as greater could not be.</hi> Joh. 15. 13. <hi>Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for his friend:</hi> If one be an enemy, you cannot ſhew greater love than to lay down your life for him, or if he be a friend, greater love cannot be ſhewen than this, to lay down your life for him.</p>
                     <p>Now did Chriſt love all men with ſo great a love, as greater cannot be ſhewen to any? If ſo, why is it that the effects of this love never reach many men ſo greateſtly loved, and yet they reach others, even becauſe they were ſo greatly loved? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. This univerſal Impetration only by the death of Chriſt cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for thoſe <hi>abſurd conſequences which depend upon it,</hi> verſe 9.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It frustrates the end of Chriſts Impetration;</hi> for when Chriſt died and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, his end therein was application of the purchaſe: He did purchaſe a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance that ſinners might be delivered, not that they might, or might not be delivered.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

5. So likewiſe doth it <hi>the Doctrine of the New Covenant of Grace</hi> which is particular.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p>4. I ſhould now diſcourſe of a fourth Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>as there never was, or ſhall be an univerſal application of the death of Chriſt; ſo neither God, nor Chriſt ever intended the ſame.</hi>

                     <p>But here the <hi>Arminians</hi> will ſave us of this labour; for they confeſs the ſame; the application, fruit, or benefit of the death of Chriſt is only for believers: And for any other death of Chriſt which is without any fruit or benefit to us, let themſelves (if they like it) take it, only give us that which is fruitful and ſaving.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Are the <hi>Arminians</hi> in good earneſt in bringing this place for Gods intention of ſalvation for all by Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>1. Do they not affirm that God neither would, nor could, <hi>velle ſalutem homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> before Chriſt had ſatisfied his Juſtice? and yet this place ſhews a ſpecial love and will in God of mans ſalvation before he gave Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. They deny the love of God in the Text, to be any act of his will at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs incomplicitly; but here it is made the immediate and prime cauſe of the giving of his Son. So that according to their Opinion, they muſt expound the place thus; God ſo loved all man-kind with ſuch a love, whereby he neither would, nor could will the ſalvation of any man, (that he ſent his Son to ſave all men, before he did intend to ſave any man) that whoſoever believes ſhould be ſaved: This is the great love which they make in God to ſave all men by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. Again, Seeing that word [world] is ambiguous, ſometimes being taken for thoſe men of whom Chriſt is the Head, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. ſometimes for thoſe men of whom Satan is the Prince, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. <hi>(The Prince of this world)</hi> it had been fit for them to have made out unto us, that both of theſe worlds were ſo loved by God, that he gave his Sonne for the Salvation of them both.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſenſe of the place ſtands evident of itſelf thus; <hi>God ſo loved the world, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> he was ſo mercifully affected towards mankind in their loſt condition, that he would not ſuffer all of them to periſh, but ſent his Son, <hi>that whoſoever believes on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it evidently appears, that Gods intention in the ſending of his Son, was for ſalvation, not of every particular man, but of every one that believes.</p>
                     <p>And indeed there the reſtriction of Gods purpoſe for ſalvation doth lie (In <hi>quiſquis credit, whoſoever believes)</hi> not that God would ſave every particular man in the world, but only every one that ſhould believe.</p>
                     <p>And queſtionleſs this was great love ſhewn to the world of man-kind univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally loſt, That Jeſus Chriſt was ſent for the recovery and ſalvation of every one of thoſe in the world that ſhould believe on him.</p>
                     <p>Nor will any <hi>Arminian</hi> dare to affirm more than this, unleſs he will maintain that there was yet a larger love in God, and a larger intention in him effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſave all the world by Chriſt diſtributively, and collectively, whether they believe, or do not believe: The Scripture plainly rejects this, and ſo do they themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Again, they object that Scripture of John 6. 51. <hi>The bread which I will give you is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> That Chriſt gave himſelf for the life of the world, is granted; and that he is <hi>the bread which giveth life to the world,</hi> verſe 33. is alſo granted; but the Point to be proved is, that Chriſt did give himſelf effectually for the life of every man in the world. But this can never be made out any farther than for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the world. verſe 35. <hi>I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger; and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> And verſe 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>2.

                     <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>ſuch a Propitiation</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is here ſaid to be <hi>(for our ſins)</hi> the ſame is here ſaid to be <hi>for the ſins (of the whole world)</hi> (otherwiſe the comfort here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were of ſmall force, if Chriſt ſhould be a propitiation for us; and for the world, in a different ſenſe; for our ſins effectually, but for the ſins of the whole world ineffectually.)</p>
                     <p>But he is a Propitiation for our ſins, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> who believe effectually, therefore he muſt alſo be a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world alſo effectually: So that if by the whole world in this place, all and every man in the world be underſtood; Then Chriſt muſt be, and is an effectual Propitiation for the ſins of every one <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he hath ſo ſatisfied and pacified God, that he is no longer diſpleaſed with any one ſinner; but this the <hi>Arminians</hi> will not maintain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſcope and purpoſe of the Apoſtle in this place, is to comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the hearts of believers in caſe of falling or ſinning, that they ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and for this he preſents two Reaſons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is, that Chriſt is our Interceſſor, or Advocate with the Father.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is, that Chriſt is the Propitiation for the ſins of all the faithful, whether Jews or Gentiles, by which he means here the whole world; not only for our ſins who are Jews, but for the ſins of the Gentiles: So that by the whole world, is meant all believers whether Jews or Gentiles (for his Epiſtle is Catholick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects them both.)</p>
                     <p>Nor is it an univerſal expreſſion when the Jews and the Gentiles are ſpoken of in way of diſtinction and oppoſition, then to call the Gentiles the world. See at your leaſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12, 15.</p>

                        <hi>Sol</hi> 1. I anſwer; To me the Conſolation riſeth very full and high; for the caſe is of ſome particular Chriſtians or Believers ſinnings <hi>(if any man ſin)</hi> in this caſe he ſupports them not to deſpair, but to hope for pardon and peace, and that from Chriſt interceſſion and Propitiation; he is the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55323:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and he is the Propitiation for their ſins, and not only for their ſins, but for the ſins alſo of all Believers, that either do, or ſhall live in the whole world, whether Jews or Gentiles; all Believers ſhall finde him ſo, <hi>Ergo,</hi> you ſhall.</p>
                     <p>2. Yet ſuppoſe, that by a Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, were meant (as the <hi>Arminians</hi> contend for) for the ſins of every man in the world: This (according to their ſenſe) would not make the Conſolation higher, but weaker: For as much as that Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, by the death of Chriſt (according to them) is of no ſpecial reſpect to any particular ſinner living, nor of any efficacy for any one more than for another, nor more for the living than for the damned; neither was there any different intention for the Collation and Application of it untill men did believe: And what more high and ſpecial comfort can ariſe to a troubled ſoul from this, I am not able to conceive.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Oject.</hi> Their next phalanx of Scriptures for Chriſt dying univerſally <hi>pro omnibus &amp; ſingulis,</hi> is muſtered up from the word (all) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>who would have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> verſe 6. <hi>Who gave himſelf a Ranſome for all;</hi> Chap. 4. 10. <hi>Who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of all thoſe that believe:</hi> Heb. 2. 9. <hi>That he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. Tit. 2. 11. Before I ſpeak to theſe places, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a few words.</p>
                     <p>1. As the word <hi>(many)</hi> in Scripture is ſometimes uſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for <hi>(all)</hi> (as Dan. 12. 2. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake, ſome to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt)</hi> So the word <hi>(all)</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put for <hi>many,</hi> as Rom. 5. 18. <hi>So by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all to juſtification of life.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>So by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made Righteous.</hi> So that it is not ſafe nor true whereſoever we read the word <hi>all,</hi> there continually to expound it for every man diſtributively,</p>
                     <p>2. To dye for <hi>all,</hi> and to be given for <hi>all,</hi> muſt in ſome places reſpect the ſufficiency of the dignity in the death of Chriſt, but not alwayes the efficacy of his death in the virtual extent of it, which none that I have read will maintain in this Point of Chriſts dying for <hi>all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let us look on the particular places mentioned for Chriſt dying for <hi>all,</hi> and every man.</p>
                     <p>1 Tim. 2. 4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all men (in this place) the Apoſtle means not every man individually, but <hi>all ſorts or kindes of men;</hi> for in the precedent verſes, he exhorts that <hi>Prayer be made for all men,</hi> and amongſt them, for <hi>Kings, and for all that are in Authority;</hi> and he ſubjoynes this Reaſon, <hi>Ergo, God will have all men to be ſaved;</hi> he excludes no ſort of men from ſalvation, but invites all ſorts and kinds of them. And therefore ſeeing the Goſpel is to be preached to all men, and there are ſome of all ſorts that God will ſave to whom the Goſpel is preached, therefore we ſhould pray for all men: Neither is it unuſual in Scripture to underſtand by all, not every particular, but all the ſorts or kinds, Joel 2. 28. <hi>I will poure my Spirit upon all fleſh;</hi> by all fleſh is not meant every man in the world, but all ſorts of perſons, your ſons and your daughters, your old men, and your young men, as there he expounds it; and upon Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as <hi>Peter</hi> expounds it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 6. <hi>All fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God:</hi> Not every particular man in the world, but all kind of Nations, and people, and Men.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſpeaks unto <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in both theſe places; he writes unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, (are believers all and every man?) nay he writes to the believers of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Corinth;</hi> are particular believers all and every man in the world?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To theſe he writes of a particular caſe, <hi>reſpecting their Chriſtian liberty</hi> about the uſe of Herbs and Meats, ſo to moderate themſelves as not to ſcandalize or offend their weak brethren, and to perplex and enſnare their conſciences: that thoſe Chriſtians who were <hi>ſtrong in faith (i. e.)</hi> were fully perſwade and ſatisfied that all meats were lawful, ſhould not ſo act their liberty thereupon as to give offence to their weak brethren (unto weak believers) who yet were not ſo clearly convinced of that liberty: He ſpeaks of believers on both ſides, ſtrong and weak, and of none other but believers concerned in the preſent fear and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; and what is this to Chriſt dying for every man?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And why would he not have the ſtrong believers (by the abuſe of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty about meats, and drinks, and herbs) to offend the Conſciences of their weak brethren? he gives the Reaſon <hi>(deſtroy not him by thy meat for whom Chriſt died; and ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died?</hi> The reaſon lies in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that offence, <hi>q. d.</hi> thus to offend them was, as much as in them lay, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, and cauſe them to periſh; For offence or ſcandal (of themſelves, and in their own natural aptitude) do tend to the ruine and deſtruction of thoſe to whom they are objected, and weak Chriſtians are likewiſe apt to be ſhaken, and wounded, and waver by them. Aſſuredly this is and ſhould be reaſon ſufficient with any believers therefore not to give ſcandal in any thing, much leſs in the uſe of meats and drinks, to other <hi>Believers</hi> who are weak; neither doth the Apoſtle ſay He is deſtroyed by thy meat for whom Chriſt died, but Deſtroy not him, &amp;c. He ſpeaks not of a work eventually done and effected, but of a work which he cautions them to beware or take heed of, as tending thereunto.</p>

And ſo in the later place he doth not abſolutely affirm that the weak brother doth periſh, but interrogatively propounds, <hi>ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died? q. d.</hi> ſhould you, or any of you be an occaſion (as much as in you lies) of the ruining of any for whom Chriſt died? therefore have a care, be wary that ye give not any offence unto them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If the Apoſtle had ſaid that any weak brother had indeed been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had indeed periſhed, yet this would not prove that Chriſt died for all and every man: All that it could inferre would be only this, that ſome Believers might be deſtroyed and periſh for whom Chriſt died; which yet appertains to another controverſie of falling from grace, and there neither will it ſerve the turn.</p>

                        </label> 1. One unto the Major, or firſt Propoſition <hi>(viz.</hi> That which every man is bound to believe, is true) a thing may be ſaid to be true in a three-fold reſpect; Either <hi>quia promittitur,</hi> becauſe it is promiſed; Or ſecondly, <hi>quia narratur,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is related or declared; Or thirdly, <hi>quia praedicitur,</hi> becauſe it is foretold; ſo that whatſoever a man is bound to believe, that ſame is true, either as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or as declared or done, or as foretold; Not alwayes true in one and the ſame reſpect, or in every reſpect; but either as promiſed, or declared or report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or as foretold. To apply this to the Argument in hand, that Chriſt died effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually for every man; If it be a truth, then it muſt be ſo, becauſe God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, or declared it, or foretold it; if it be a truth, becauſe promiſed, then it is with condition of faith; for though the very promiſe be true in it ſelf, yet it is not performed unto us, without believing; the ſame promiſe ſtill requiring faith for the performance of it, and then this will not prove that it is true that Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all and every man abſolutely, but only for Believers, or for all men only under the condition of faith: If it be a truth becauſe only declared, or foretold, then whether a man believes, or believes not, this is true that Chriſt died for him; the reaſon is, all things which are true by way of Narration or Prediction, they are true upon their own account, they are true before we believe them (our faith makes them not to be ſo) and if we believe them not, yet are they true; our <hi>unbelief cannot make the truth of God a lye:</hi> But I ſuppoſe that no <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> will ſay that Chriſt dyed effectually for every man, whether he doth believe, or doth not believe.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond anſwer ſhall be unto the Minor Propoſition <hi>(But every man is bound to believe that Christ dyed for him)</hi> to this I would ſay three things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is a material diſputable Point, Whether thoſe to whom the Goſpel is not revealed, are bound to believe that Chriſt died for them? becauſe the Precept of believing is a Goſpel Precept only, and the puniſhment for unbelief is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and inflicted in relation to the Goſpel, for ſlighting and refuſing that Chriſt who is revealed and offered by the Goſpel unto ſinners, who alſo are therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to believe on Chriſt: and if this be ſo, then certainly every man is not bound to believe that Chriſt died for him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When the Goſpel doth come, it doth not abſolutely command that every one ſhould believe that Chriſt dyed for him indeed; it doth command every one to believe on Chriſt <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to receive him, and truſt on him alone for life. But it doth not command him to believe (without any more ado, without any condition whatſoever) that Chriſt died for him <hi>(i. e.)</hi> hath by his death made his peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his pardon and eternal life. For the Goſpel doth not reveale or command any ſuch thing: It doth reveale a Chriſt who died for ſinners, and it doth offer this Chriſt to ſinners; but with all it ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> Doth the Goſpel command every man abſolutely to believe that Chriſt dyed for him (which takes in the Application of all the fruits and benefits of the death of Chriſt which a ſoule can enjoy) whether a man obey the voice of the Goſpel or not, receive Chriſt or not! <hi>q. d.</hi> you are bound to believe that Chriſt died for you, though you never by faith cloſe with the offer of Chriſt, though your
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55323:166"/>
heart never prize him, or never are brought in unto him! and though you ſtill love your ſins and perſevere in them. Tell me in good ſadneſs, did Jeſus Chriſt ever ſign ſuch a Commiſſion as this, Go preach the Goſpel, and tell people that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they receive me, or will not receive me; whether they become believers, or continue unbelievers; whether they repent, or continue impenitent; they are bound every man of them to believe that I dyed for them, and reconciled them, and have procured ſalvation for them! Certainly if every man were bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, he were bound to believe a falſhood; for verily Chriſt did not die for thoſe who remain unbelievers and impenitent: and the Goſpel is ſo far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing life by the death of Chriſt to impenitent and unbelieving perſons, that it threatens and ſeals death, and wrath, and condemnation on them: Joh. 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi> Joh. 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> ver. 18. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>immediate Object of that faith which God at firſt requires, is not this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chriſt dyed for me; But Chriſt who dyed:</hi> And the firſt command of Faith in the Goſpel, is to accept Chriſt, and reſt on Chriſt, and then follows a fiduciary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that Chriſt died for me: And indeed no man can come to that degree of Faith to be perſwaded or confident that Chriſt died for him, untill he firſt by faith receive Chriſt offered unto him.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, That Chriſt with his grace of Redemption is <hi>(Indefinitely offered unto ſinners by the Goſpel)</hi> and that all who do by their infidelity refuſe that grace, are deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly damned, not becauſe they reject the grace offered belonging to them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers and impenitent; but becauſe they neglect and deſpiſe that condition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which grace was offered unto them; Chriſt and his grace were offered unto them upon this condition, If they would believe and receive him and it; But they will not believe <hi>(You will not come unto me that you might have life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40.) And though light be come into the world, yet they will not receive it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Unbelievers who do reject Chriſt with his grace offered unto them, do not reject him, and that grace, becauſe they know that neither Chriſt nor his grace do belong to them; this neither is, nor can be the reaſon <hi>à priore,</hi> of their rejection, becauſe no particular ſinner (unto whom the Goſpel comes) can know that Chriſt hath ſimply excluded him, and tends no good to him: and he ſees that to others in the ſame condition and depth of ſin and unworthineſs with himſelf, Chriſt and his grace offered by the Goſpel are effectual. But therefore they do reject Chriſt, becauſe <hi>they love him not, (they love darkneſs rather than light,)</hi> Joh. 3. 19. and are led by their perverſe will, ſo as utterly to refuſe communion with Chriſt and ſubjection to him: for which they are deſervedly puniſhed.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. And why ſo, I pray you? Is this to be ſet up as the only ground why we muſt believe in Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt hath died for all and every man! when yet themſelves do ſay, though Chriſt hath ſo died for all and every man, yet no man is the better for this untill, and unleſs he believe. Or doth the Goſpel when it calls upon ſinners to believe on Chriſt, propound this as the inducement unto the ſoul, Chriſt died for all men, and for every man; therefore you ſhould believe on Chriſt: and untill you be ſure that Chriſt did thus dye and obtain Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all and every man, and Remiſſion of ſins, and eternal life for all, you may not,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55323:167"/>
and muſt not believe. When <hi>Peter</hi> called upon thoſe Jews to believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Paul</hi> upon the <hi>Jaylor (believe and you ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Chap. 16.) did they uſher this duty in with impoſing this Precedent certainty to them, that they muſt ſubſcribe firiſt unto that Point, That Chriſt dyed for all and every man; therefore you ſhould believe?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But there is no cauſe of this ſuſpence or doubting at all, whether a perſon ſhould believe on Chriſt, though Chriſt did not die for all men; becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (without that error) affords Grounds or Reaſons enough for any man to (whom it is preached) to believe on Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, neither ſo, nor ſo; neither the one nor the other abſurdity will ariſe neceſſarily out of that Doctrine, that Chriſt dyed not for all, that ſome of <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity are no ſinners, and ſo need no Reconciliation by Chriſt, or that elſe they muſt deſpair, being in the ſame condition with the Divels themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For firſt, moſt certain it is, that <hi>in Adam all ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin all do ſtand in need of Reconciliation by Chriſt; but hence it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, becauſe that all men (are ſinners) and do ſtand in need of ſuch a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, therefore God muſt and doth give Chriſt as a Reconciliation for them all: No more then this will follow, becauſe that ſo many Malefactors are in peril of their life, therefore the Prince againſt whom they have offended, muſt either pardon or offer pardon to every one of them; for though there be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſity of pardon as unto all of them, becauſe of their guilt, yet the giving of pardon is an act of meer grace; and therefore the Prince offended may beſtow it on ſome of them only, and not on all of them: Thus ſtands the caſe 'twixt God and us, we have all ſinned againſt him, and therefore come ſhort of the glory of God, and ſtand in need of mercy, and Reconciliation by Chriſt; and God ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy;</hi> ſome of theſe ſinners I will ſave by Chriſt, namely all them that believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. others of theſe I will not ſave, namely thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not: though there be a need of Reconciliation in reſpect of all men, yet it is the pleaſure of God not effectually to beſtow ſalvation on them all: Nor is God (as to the event and iſſue of this) at all unjuſt, ſeeing that he leaves them only to wrath and condemnation, who do continue unbelieving and impenitent.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, Neither will that follow, that the condition of ſome men <hi>(i. e.)</hi> unbelievers, muſt be the ſame with that of the Divels (without any hope of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) if Chriſt not dye for all. For</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Divels had no Mediatour at all given unto them in reſpect of their kind, for one or other; but ſo mankind had, foraſmuch as <hi>Chriſt took part of the nature of mankind,</hi> Heb. 2. 14.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Divels (all of them) are in an eſtate of actual damnation, they are every one of them actually damned; but ſo is not every man, no nor yet every one that believes not in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:55323:167"/>
3. The Divels have their damnation ſo ſealed upon them, that every one of them doth know there is no hope of ſalvation at all for them; but thus it is not with any particular unbeliever living; for though the unbelieving perſon doth deſerve eternal damnation, yet he hath the means offered to eſcape that damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea he doth know that if he continues unbelieving, he ſhall not eſcape the wrath of God; yet he doth not know whether God may not give him grace to change his unbelieving heart, after a long time of unbelief. Neither can we ſay of any unbeliever, nor can any unbeliever ſay of himſelf, God will never give him grace that he may be converted and believe; and therefore it is not true that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer is in the ſame hopeleſs condition with the Divels.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Aſſertion that Chriſt did not effectually dye for all men, is no more apt in the nature of it to cauſe any to deſpair than theſe expreſſions of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 16. <hi>There are but few which are choſen:</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that finde it.</hi> Would, or may you argue from theſe expreſſions of Chriſt, that theſe who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the number of thoſe few, muſt now deſpair, and they are in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the Divels? why then will you reaſon thus from Chriſt not dying for all and every man?</p>
                     <p>And yet fourthly, we may add this to all the reſt, That thoſe ſinners who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue (who live and dye) impenitent and unbelieving, theſe do (in the event) cut off themſelves from all hope of ſalvation; As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of the Gentiles lying in their natural condition, <hi>That at the ſame time they were without Chriſt, and aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. that we may ſafely ſay of all obſtinate, impenitent, and unbelieving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (living and dying ſo) they are without Chriſt, and without hope, and ſhall go into that hell which is prepared for the Divel and his angels; in the event their condition will not be different.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It is well that the <hi>Arminians</hi> are ſo tender for the certain knowledge of any mans ſalvation by Chriſt: they leave God to an uncertainty of any mans particular ſalvation, notwithſtanding the death of Chriſt for all men, &amp; yet they will ſay This death of Chriſt for all men, as a ground of certainty unto us: wherein yet they deal;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Very fraudulently</hi> with us; for though they ſay that Chriſt dyed for all, yet they expreſly teach that the application of Chriſts death for actual ſalvation, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them that believe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Very falſly;</hi> for according to this Doctrine no man can ever be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his ſalvation, untill the very laſt gaſp of his perſevrance in grace, and that many periſh eternally for whom Chriſt died.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, but let us ſee whether according to their Doctrine of Chriſts dying for all men, one may certainly conclude (to the ſatisfaction, and peace, and comfort of his conſcience) that Chriſt died for him. Let the ground for certainty be drawn up thus; Chriſt died for all men; but I am a man; therefore certainly Chriſt died to ſave me: Or, Chriſt died to ſave all ſinners; but I am a ſinner; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt died to ſave me. I think any underſtanding Chriſtian would find miſerable ground of ſatisfaction and certainty from this in the time of a perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience. But we have another way, and far ſurer from the Scripture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55323:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our certainty of Chriſts dying for us, and to ſave us. Jeſus Chriſt dyed for all Believers effectually to ſave them, (this the Scripture expreſly affirms) but I do truely believe in Chriſt, and therefore I certainly conclude that Chriſt did die for me to ſave me. And thus I have gone through this great Controverſie about the latitude of Chriſts death, where I find thus much, that it is neceſſary for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to get faith, who will indeed be the better for the death of Chriſt; it ſhall therefore be our wiſdom to leave diſputing, and humbly to beg of God to give us Faith, that ſo we may believe on Chriſt to the ſalvation of our ſoules.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> For the reſolving of this Scruple, be pleaſed to conſider a few places.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is <hi>a difference</hi> 'twixt <hi>a general aſſent,</hi> and 'twixt <hi>a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and Application: It is one thing to know and acknowledge this general Truth (that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, and that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhall beſaved, and that whoſoever repents ſhall have his ſins pardoned) and it is another thing by faith to know that Chriſt died for me, that his blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of my ſins, that I am reconciled by his death, and that I ſhall be ſaved by his life; to ſay of Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> once did, <hi>he loved me,</hi> and <hi>gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is not propounded about that general knowledge and aſſent of faith, whether a perſon may certainly know that truth that Chriſt died for ſinners, and will ſave all that believe; but about a particular knowledge of that truth, as in relation and application unto this or that perſon, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a certainty</hi> as the Papiſts do diſtinguiſh, and with whom we prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally contend in this Controverſie, <hi>of hope</hi> which depends upon probable grounds; and there is <hi>a certainty of faith</hi> which depends upon ſure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving grounds.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is not whether a perſon may attain only unto ſome good hope and probable conjecture that Chriſt died for him, that his ſins are pardoned, that he ſhall be ſaved; in which conjecture he may yet be deceived; but whether he may attain unto a certainty of faith upon grounds proper to believers, and to them who ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We muſt diſtinguiſh <hi>'twixt ſeeming believers</hi> who reſt in common Notions of Chriſt, and in a viſible profeſſion only: and 'twixt <hi>real and ſound Believers,</hi> whoſe hearts and ſouls God hath touched, and perſwaded, and drawn to Chriſt, and they are effectually brought into union and communion with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not of the former, who yet are very apt to deceive themſelves with an extream (but ungrounded) confidence that Chriſt died for them; but only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ſound believers who are indeed married unto Chriſt, and are branches of <note place="margin">A believer may know by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of faith that Chriſt died for him.</note> the Vine, and members of the Body.</p>
                     <p>So that now the ſumme of the Anſwer is this, <hi>That a truely believing perſon may know with a certainty of Faith, not only that Chriſt died for ſinners, but alſo</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> The Apoſtle doth only put them upon a tryal, whether Chriſt be in them yea or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 'Tis true, that is the work which he puts them upon. But</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I demand, Is that work feaſable or not? is it poſſible for them to come unto that knowledge of Chriſts being in them (upon that rryal) or is it not? if it be not poſſible, then he earneſtly preſſeth them to a fruitleſſe duty, and ſuccesſleſs labour; If it be poſſible, that they might upon the trial come to know that Chriſt is in them, then the thing is granted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I thus argue, They <hi>who may come</hi> (upon trial) <hi>to know that Chriſt is in them, may certainly know that Chr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſt died for them, to ſave them:</hi> My reaſon is this, That Jeſus Chriſt is in none but in them for whom he died, and whom he will ſave; Col. 1. 27. <hi>Chriſt is in you the hope of glory.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life: and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one may know that Chriſt is in him of a truth, then he may know that Chriſt died for him in particular for his ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If <hi>Believers may attain to joy and rejoycing in the death of Chriſt,</hi> yea unto a <hi>triumphing in it,</hi> then they may certainly know that Chriſt died for them, and hath purchaſed Reconciliation, Remiſſion, and ſalvation for them: The conſequence I prove thus, There are three things neceſſarily concurring to cauſe Spiritual joy and rejoycing, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>A delightful rejoycing Object.</hi> 2. <hi>An applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Object to the deſire of the ſoul.</hi> 1. <hi>A knowledge of that application:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gerſon. Park.</hi> 2. <hi>Comp. de Dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatione. p.</hi> 161.</note> and indeed without that knowledge that ſuch an Object is ours, or is for us, there never will be actual rejoycing, but if it be impoſſible, then diſpair; and if it be doubtful, then fear, &amp;c. But believers may attain to joy and rejoycing in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. and that upon the account of his beneficial dying for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the Atonement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I will add but one other Argument, and that is is this, <hi>We are bound to love Jeſus Chriſt who died for us</hi> and abundantly to thank and bleſſe God for our Redemption, and Reconciliation, and Remiſſion, and Salvation by Chriſt; this I ſuppoſe no man will deny; but we can neither do the one nor the other, if we cannot attain unto a certainty that Chriſt died for us.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Love of Chriſt</hi> depends upon the knowledge of his love to us; It is not with this ſpiritual love, as it is with natural love, where you may love a perſon although you know not his love unto you; but our ſpiritual love neceſſarily ariſeth from the application and knowledge of a precedent love unto us; <hi>we love him, q.</hi> becauſe <hi>he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 19 you muſt be able to ſee and know the love of Chriſt to you, before you can be able to raiſe or return love to him; and therefore do we love Chriſt, becauſe his love is manifeſted unto us. Now if this love of Chriſt to us (which he ſhewed in dying for us; <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friend,</hi> Joh. 15. 13.) be perpetually hid from us, that we can never attain the certain knowledge thereof (but muſt only gueſs at it, perhaps Chriſt loved us to dye for us, perhaps he did not) how can our hearts poſſibly be raiſed to a ſolid fixed intenſive reciprocal love of him!</p>
                     <p>2. In like manner, how <hi>can our thankfulneſs</hi> be indeed rightly returned unto God for giving of Chriſt for us to reconcile and ſave us? for according to your knowledge in this caſe, will be your thankfulneſs; can you ever thank, and bleſs
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55323:169"/>
and praiſe God for Chriſt and his death, and the benefits thereof to you, whiles you know not that they belong to you? O Lord! I bleſs thee for that exceeding love of thine in giving Chriſt to redeem my ſoul, to make my peace, to diſcharge my ſins, to ſave my ſoul, &amp;c. But truly I know not whether this be ſo or no, I am utterly uncertain whether Chriſt dyed for me, or whether himſelf, or any benefit by him and his death, doth indeed concern me or belong unto me, &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a pertinent Queſtion indeed, ſaid a dying perſon (whom ſome of us knew in this place) But did Chriſt dye for my ſins? but did Chriſt dye for my ſoul? but did he dye for me? How ſhall I know that Chriſt died for me, for my ſins, to ſave my ſoul? This is a queſtion which many of us firſt or laſt will make queſtion of; when trouble of conſcience ariſeth, or when death appoacheth, O then how may I know that Chriſt is my Chriſt, and that he died for me! This is the higheſt of all queſtions, Did Chriſt dye for me? and a moſt neceſſary que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; what though Chriſt did dye for others, and they partake of the benefits of his death, if he did not die for me, and if I be not ſaved by his death! and if the conſcience can once upon ſure grounds be ſatisfied in this queſtion, ſo that a perſon knows that Chriſt died for him; now there is peace, and joy, and thankſgiving, and a lively hope of ſalvation: all is ſure, if once we can get to be ſure that Chriſt is ours, and did die for us.</p>
                     <p>For anſwer therefore unto the queſtion propounded, be pleaſed to remember (in the general) that there are three ſorts of perſons in the world; namely</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Some</hi> who (in the preſent eſtate under which they lye) <hi>cannot know that Chriſt dyed for them,</hi> and will ſave them; I ſay, in the preſent eſtate wherein they are; For though there may be a poſſibility of the change of that eſtate, and ſo a capacity may come in for that particular knowledge and certainty, yet as to their preſent eſtate (abſolulely conſidered) there is an incapacity of immediate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Chriſt died for them. Theſe perſons are all unbelieving and impenitent perſons who (as ſo, and remaining ſo) cannot know that Chriſt died to ſave them, becauſe</p>
                     <p>1. The way to know that Chriſt died for us, muſt ariſe either from ſome <note place="margin">In the general. Some cannot know.</note> 
                        <hi>word of promiſe,</hi> that a perſon in ſuch a condition, having intereſt in Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved by him; but there is no ſuch promiſe to any unbelieving and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent perſon, as ſuch a perſon; or from ſome <hi>words of Narration</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and affirm that Chriſt and the benefits of his death do belong unto unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and impenitent perſons as ſo: But there is no ſuch Narrative word which affirms it, that Chriſt belongs unto the unbeliever, and that he hath indeed obtained pardon of ſins and life for him; or <hi>from faith</hi> wrought in the heart: But this is not in the unbelieving and impenitent perſon; if it were, then he were not unbelieving or <hi>from ſome internal teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> witneſſing and ſealing the application of the death of Chriſt in the benefits of it unto the unbelieving and impenitent perſon: But ſuch a teſtimony the Spirit of Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives to any perſon remaining unbelieving and impenitent; his witneſſing and ſealing being only to the children of God. (Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit itſelf bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſſe with our ſpirits that we are the children of God)</hi> and follows on

                     </p>
                     <p>So that there is no way for any unbeliever and impenitent perſon to know that Chriſt dyed for his ſins, and to make his peace, and to ſave his ſoul; and unleſſe his unbelief and impenitency be changed, he can never know it.</p>
                     <p>2.

                        </label> And therefore by the way let me hint unto you two things.</p>
                     <p>One is, that all ſuch perſons who do continue to ſlight and refuſe Chriſt, and will go on in their ſinful ways, they have certainly deceived themſelves, and do ſtill deceive themſelves in their preſumptuous confidence that Chriſt hath dyed for them, and ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of their ſins, and that they ſhall be ſaved as well as the beſt. Theſe rude confidences are but <hi>lying vanities,</hi> and ungrounded preſumptions, refuges and deluſions of their own making; and who ſo truſts unto them, will in the end periſh; for the Scripture is ſo far from offering Chriſt in the benefits of his death to unbelieving and impenitent perſons continuing in that eſtate, that it aſſures them of the quite contrary, that they ſhall not ſee life, that they ſhall not be ſaved, that they ſhall dye in their ſins and periſh.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond is, that we would every one of us look ſeriouſly into our conditions, and if we do finde them to be unbelieving and impenitent, then (as we love our lives, and tender our ſalvation by Chriſt) humbly and earneſtly to importune the Lord to deliver our ſouls from unbelief and impenitency, they being the ſins which elſe will hinder us not only of the benefits by the death of Chriſt, but alſo of Chriſt himſelf, without an intereſt in whom we cannot have any intereſt in the benefits purchaſed by his death.</p>

                     <p>Theſe things being thus opened, it will not now be ſo difficult for any mans conſcience to ſay, whether he be any one of the people of Chriſt yea or no; for two things will plainly teſtifie it: One is the <hi>willingneſſe of his heart to become Chriſts;</hi> and the other is the <hi>choiceneſſe or excellency of his nature;</hi> both theſe are in all the people of Chriſt, and in none but the people of Chriſt; and if you finde theſe upon your hearts, then are you the people of Chriſt; and if you be his people, then aſſuredly he dyed to ſave you from your ſins.</p>
                     <p>They are the <hi>ſheep</hi> of Chriſt (his ſheep for whom he did lay down his life) <note place="margin">His Sheep.</note> who do hear his voice and follow him; thus doth Chriſt himſelf deſcribe his ſheep, <hi>John</hi> 10 27. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and they follow me.</hi> And Ver. 28. <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh:</hi> Well then, hence a man <note place="margin">Hence a man may conclude, Negatively.</note> may conclude both Negatively and Affirmatively:</p>

                     <p>And on the contrary, one can ſay I do hear the voice of Chriſt, and I do follow <note place="margin">Affirmatively.</note> him. His voice ſaith <hi>Come unto me,</hi> Matth. 11. 28. and I come unto him; his voice ſaith, <hi>Open the door,</hi> Revel. 3. 20. and receive me; and my heart is open unto him, and I do receive him; his voice ſaith, <hi>Be converted that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 2. 19. and I do repent and am converted; his voice ſaith, <hi>Hearken unto me and your ſouls ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 2. and I do obey this voice of Chriſt, I hearken unto him and yield up my ſelf to the ſervice and obedience of his will. Why hence I can conclude, I am therefore one of the ſheep of Chriſt; and being ſo. I am ſure that Chriſt did lay down his life for me.</p>
                     <p>Again, Jeſus Chriſt ſaith that <hi>he layes down his life for his friends:</hi> And in <note place="margin">His friends.</note> that very place he gives two Characters of ſuch who are indeed his friends.</p>
                     <p>One on their parts: Joh. 15. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other on his part: <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. <hi>I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> The meaning is, As betwixt friends there is a reciprocal love, ſo there is between Chriſt and his friends; Chriſt loves them, and they love Chriſt. That they love Chriſt as friends, (indeed) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their readineſſe to do whatſoever Chriſt ſhall be pleaſed to command; they are ready to take up his will, and are chearfully at his command: That Chriſt loves them as his friends, appears by the manifeſtation and communicating unto them the ſecrets of his Father; he tells unto them the love and minde of his Father in the great concernments of ſalvation, which he doth not effectually make known to every man. So now this ſtands as a firme and unmoveable ttuth, that Chriſt did effectually lay down his life for his friends: And ſecondly, that they are the very friends of Chriſt, who (firſt) are at the command of Chriſt; And (ſecondly) unto whom Chriſt doth in a more ſpecial and familiar way make known the minde of his Father in the matters of ſalvation. Therefore if you do experimentally finde an heart readily and chearfully affected to all the will and command of Chriſt, What wilt thou have me to do? his commands are not grievous, I delight to do thy will; then are you ſure that you are one of the friends of Chriſt; and if ſo, then are you ſure that Chriſt laid down his life for you. And if you do experimentally finde ſuch impartings of Chriſt to you from

the Father (which the men of the world know not) in the ſenſe of his love, and taſte of his mercy, and fruits of his grace, and efficacies of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Spirit, thence you may certainly conclude that you are his friends; (for Chriſt effectually makes theſe known only to his friends) and if you be his friends, then undoubtedly Chriſt dyed for you, he laid down his life to ſave you.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe might I go over the other inſtances of the body, and of the Church of Chriſt; but I have ſaid enough unto this choice diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, One may know that Chriſt dyed for him in particular, by the <hi>quality of thoſe perſons who in Scripture have been able to ſay upon ſure grounds that Chriſt dyed for them, and redeemed them;</hi> and unto whom the benefits of his death have been applied in particular.

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why, what kinde of perſons were they?</hi>

                     <p>I will go no farther; Finde me but ſuch a faith as this, and I aſſure you, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you; nay, the Goſpel of Chriſt aſſures you, that this is true faith; th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55323:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Faith which makes Chriſt yours, in his Perſon, and in all the Benefits of his Death.</p>
                     <p>And one thing more obſerve by the way, that though this faith be but <hi>weak,</hi> though it be but as the <hi>ſmoaking flax,</hi> though it be but as <hi>a grain of Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed;</hi> though it be much aſſaulted with Satans temptations, though it be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhaken with fears and doubtings: Yet if it be but of ſo much life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to match thy heart to Chriſt, to bring it in to Chriſt, to ſet him up as thy Lord, and as thy Saviour; and to rol, and reſt, and caſt thy ſoul and confidence on him, it is true Faith, and Chriſt is thine, and thou mayeſt ſafely conclude that Chriſt dyed for thee, and made peace for thee, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, One may know that Chriſt did effectually dye for him by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the death of Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Benefits purchaſed by the death of Chriſt,</hi> and by the conjoyned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of them in reſpect of himſelf. Beloved, the benefits purchaſed by the death of Chriſt are many (as Remiſſion of ſins, and Reconciliation with God, and Eternal life, and Redemption, and Sanctification, &amp;c.) And theſe purchaſed Benefits, they were all of them purchaſed at once and together, and all of them with reſpect to every Believer, and in time every one of them is applyed to every Believer. Chriſt did not purchaſe Remiſſion of ſins for one believer only, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation only for another believer, and Grace only for another, and Glory only for another; neither doth Chriſt apply theſe partly to one, and partly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but he purchaſed them for every one that ſhall believe, and he applies them to every one that doth believe. 1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>Made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 6. <hi>This is he that came by Water and Blood, even Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Unto which let me add the fifth character by which one may know <note place="margin">By the ends of the death of Chriſt.</note> that Chriſt died for him, <hi>viz. by the ends of the death of Chriſt</hi> in reſpect of us, and the appearance of them upon our hearts and lives. 2 Cor. 5. 15. <hi>He died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who died for them, and roſe again.</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zealous of good works:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body upon the Croſſe, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs, by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe places you ſee five ends of the death of Chriſt for us:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That he might redeem us from all iniquity (i. e.)</hi> ſet us at liberty from bondage unto our ſinful luſts, that <hi>henceforth</hi> we <hi>ſhould not ſerve ſinne,</hi> Rom. 6. 6.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That we ſhould be dead to ſin (i. e.)</hi> our hearts and affections ſhould be mortified and crucified unto them; not love them, not deſire them, not delight in them, not hearken to them, not be led by them any more.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That henceforth we ſhould not live unto our ſelves (i. e.)</hi> intend and ſet up our own ends and intereſts, our own praiſe and glory, our own profit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, our own pleaſure and contentments.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>That we ſhould be a peculiar people,</hi> be his, be for him unto himſelf, purified by his ſpirit, and joyned by the ſame Spirit unto himſelf, and led and drawn forth in his ſtrength unto all good works, affectionately and fervently.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>That we ſhould live unto him who died for us,</hi> and live unto righteouſneſs, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> exalt the will, and wayes, and honour of Chriſt count nothing too dear for him, ſpend, and be ſpent for him; take his directions, obey his commands, ſerve his ends, act intirely, and throughly, and willingly, and chearfully, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſtantly in all conditions, and in all tryals for Chriſts intereſt, and the magnifying of Chriſt. O Beloved, let us ſeriouſly try our intereſt in the death of Chriſt by theſe Ends of the death of Chriſt which
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55323:173"/>
are certainly accompliſhed (in due time) in all for whom Chriſt died.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of the vertues of the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Some <hi>are for us;</hi> he died for to ſatifie for us, and to make peace for us, and to purchaſe Remiſſion of ſins for us, and to obtain ſalvation for us.</item>
                        <item>2. Some <hi>are in us,</hi> as to redeem us from all iniquity, to crucifie our ſins, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us unto himſelf a peculiar people, &amp;c.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Chriſt died for our ſins, and he died that we might dye unto our ſins <hi>(Our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 6. The blood of Chriſt was a <hi>pacifying blood, (having made peace through the blood of his Croſſe,</hi> Col. 1. 20.) And the blood of Chriſt is <hi>a purifying blood,</hi> it <hi>purgeth</hi> the <hi>conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. He died as <hi>our Surety and Prieſt,</hi> and to this end alſo did Chriſt die and riſe again, that he might be <hi>Lord both of the dead and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> Rom. 14. 9 Therefore if you be yet in your ſins, if you be not dead unto them; if you love them, if you ſerve them, you cannot aſſure your ſelves (as yet) that Chriſt dyed for you: But on the contrary, if you can truly ſay (as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17, 18.) <hi>We were the ſervants of ſin, but we are made free from ſin, and are become the ſervants of righteouſneſs;</hi> we are healed by the ſtripes of Chriſt, and we are made <hi>conformable</hi> unto his death, we find the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of his Death and Reſurrection in us; we are not our own but Chriſts; his we are, and none but his; our hearts are his, and our lives are his; why then be confident that Chriſt is yours, and his death is yours, and all the benefits of his death are yours.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, One may know that Chriſt died for him, by <hi>the Grounds,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By the grounds and cauſes, and order of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> 
                        <hi>and Cauſes, and Order of attaining unto that certainty of knowledge, and perſwaſion that Chriſt died for him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For your help in this, take notice of three Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A right and undeceiving aſſurance that Chriſt died for us, hath two ſure Grounds: One is, the <hi>Teſtimony of the Word;</hi> the other is, the <hi>Testimony of Conſcience renewed. The Word</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever believes, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life: Renewed conſcience</hi> ſaith, but thou believeſt, yea thou believeſt aright; thy faith work by love; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. A right and undeceiving knowledge, it hath very <hi>choice cauſes;</hi> it ariſeth from <hi>Faith,</hi> and it ariſeth from the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> no man can give himſelf this aſſurance or certain knowledge that Chriſt died for him: As no man can ſay <hi>that Christ is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> So no man can ſay Chriſt is my Lord, and my Saviour, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A right and undeceiving aſſurance that Chriſt died for me, is attained in an <hi>orderly way:</hi> It is not the firſt work to be found in us, but it follows many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent works in the ſoule, as the ſealing follows the writing; <hi>viz.</hi> it follows</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Deep ſenſe of ſin and miſery.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>A Spiritual Conviction of our own impotency,</hi> and inſufficiency, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute need of Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Earneſt deſires</hi> after Chriſt, and for faith to lay hold on Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>Many conflicts</hi> 'twixt weak faith, and doubtings and fears.</item>
                        <item>5. <hi>Peculiar ſupplications</hi> for the evidencing of the love of Chriſt, and for particular perſwaſions of our intereſt in him, and in the benefits of his death.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Seventhly, You may know that Chriſt died for your ſins, by <hi>the concomitant preſence of ſome choice qualities in every perſon rightly aſſured of Chriſts dying</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome chief qualities.</note>

                        <hi>whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourn as a man mourns for his only child</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did the child mourn more, &amp;c. There is a two-fold mourning, and both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: one from ſenſe of ſin as grieving God; the other from the ſenſe of love in pardoning ſin.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>An exceeding joy:</hi> Rom. 5. 11. <hi>We joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the Atonement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. An <hi>inflamed love.</hi> Luke 7. 47. <hi>Her ſins which are many are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> (For) is not Cauſal but Illative, <hi>q. d.</hi> therefore ſhe loved much. None ſo loved as this loving Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>A ſweet Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity:</hi> Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> when we know that our peace is made by Chriſt, preſently peace ariſeth in the conſcience, the ſtorm is over, and we are at land: Now conſcience excuſes, comforts, ſupports, anſwers, &amp;c. all is well, the Sword is ſheathed.</p>
                     <p>8. Laſtly, you may know that Chriſt died for you, <hi>by the fruits and effects</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Utmoſt ſervice for Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> acts us, fills us, carries us on as men poſſeſſed, or as a ſhip with the winde: Act. 21. 13. <hi>I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Special delight in Chriſt, and in the word of Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 3. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</hi> If ſo be that ye <hi>have taſted</hi> that <hi>the Lord is gracious;</hi> as if he had ſaid, the man that knows that the Lord is gracious, and gracious to him, and hath taſted of the ſweetneſs of his love to his ſoul, muſt needs delight in, and long after the Word, as the Babe doth after the milk of the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>4. Yet more <hi>deſires to partake of more from Chriſt:</hi> Phil. 3. 10. <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, being made conformable to his death.</hi> verſe 12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I alſo am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Watchful fear,</hi> by no means to offend or diſpleaſe Chriſt, ſo loving a Chriſt, ſo kind, ſo good a Chriſt; ſo unwilling, and ſo affraid is the aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſin againſt Chriſt any more, that he could be content preſently to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>6. <hi>Anſwerable returns</hi> unto Chriſt who ſuffered and died for me, <hi>v. g.</hi> He loved me, and I therefore love him; He abaſed himſelf for me, and I abaſe my ſelf for him; He gave himſelf for me, and I give my ſelf to him; He obeyed his Fathers will for me, and I obey his will; He ſuffered for me, and I am willing to ſuffer for him, in my name, in my body, in my life.

                     <p>There is (I confeſs) a <hi>two-fold confidence</hi> about the Application of the Death of Chriſt; One <hi>ariſing from Faith and the Spirit of God,</hi> who beareth witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God; The other ariſeth <hi>from preſumption,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit of Deluſion,</hi> wherein a perſon dreams that he eats, but he is empty; and dreams that he poſſeſſeth, and he is poor; and dreams that Chriſt is his, and died for his ſins, and made his peace, but he is deceived, there is no ſuch matter at all.</p>

And yet you remain an ignorant, and impenitent, a diſobedient, and unbelieving ſinner; you ſtill love your ſins, and will not forſake them; your heart is hardened in ſin, and you mourn not for ſin, you deſpiſe the Goſpel of Chriſt, and truth of Chriſt, and calls of Chriſt, and paths of Chriſt, and ſubjection to Chriſt, and communion with Chriſt! And yet you are confident that Chriſt died effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> for your ſalvation! And what warrant have you thus to lay claim to him, and to his benefits? The Word ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever believes on him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16, 36. <hi>And he that believeth not ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> And you believe not on him; where is now your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence? the Word ſaith, <hi>be converted,</hi> and <hi>repent, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 19. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Name,</hi> Luke 24. 47. But you repent not, you do not, you will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your ſins. The Word ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is the Author of ſalvation to all that obey him,</hi> Hebr. 5. 9. But you will not obey him; he calls you off from your ſins, and he calls you off from the world, and he calls you to fellowſhip with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he calls you unto holineſſe; but you will not obey him in any of theſe calls; therefore your confidence in the benefits of his death, is a meer preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and deluſion, it is not warranted by the Word; nay, the Word is expreſſely contrary unto it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>When that confidence is but natural, and eaſily believed:</hi> The right confidence <note place="margin">Which is but natural, and eaſily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> that Chriſt dyed for us, it is ſupernatural and difficult; we cannot give it to our ſelves, it is a perſwaſion given unto us, and it coſts us many prayings, and many tears, and many bearings, and many waitings upon God before we can attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: But a deluding confidence that is natural and eaſie, the perſon never gets it by prayer; never wreſtled with God for it, never attended the Word for it, never conflicted with doubts and fears, was never at any coſt for it, but was confident all his days; no antecedent conflict, no preſent conflict; preſumption is a work of our own, a meer fancy of our own, and a meer deluſion of our own.</p>

Thirdly, When <hi>that confidence is fruitleſſe and looſe,</hi> it produceth no love <note place="margin">Which is fruitleſſe.</note> at all to Chriſt, nor fear to offend Chriſt, nor care to pleaſe Chriſt; nay, inſtead of theſe, there is a boldneſſe to ſin the more, and to continue impenitent, becauſe Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and his death is ſufficient to expiate the greateſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; whereas a right confidence of the benefits of the death of Chriſt makes men more holy and obedient. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 3. <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When <hi>that confidence or aſſurance is eaſily ſwept away in time of</hi>

                        <hi>tryal,</hi> either by conſcience or by afflictions, or by ſickneſſe or by the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of death; <hi>His confidence ſhall be rooted out of his Tabernacle, and ſhall bring him to the King of terrors,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bildad</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 18. 14. A deluding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence uſually ends in a deſpairing diffidence; but ſo doth not a right and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded confidence, it will hold out in all afflictions and tryals whatſoever. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Yea, it will hold out in death it ſelf, when all the hopes of the hypocrite ſhall periſh. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From all this let us learn carefully to try our very confidences of our intereſt in Chriſt, and in the benefits of his death; remember but three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Your intereſt is never the more for all your confidence;</hi> confidence gives no propriety, though ſometimes it follows it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Your intereſt is the leſſe if your confidence be falſe.</hi> A troubled and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian may be brought in to Chriſt, and partake of him, and of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, when the bold, confident, preſumptuous ſinner keeps off, and hides himſelf, even becauſe he is boiſtrouſly confident.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>You will certainly be loſt if you rest in this confident deluſion;</hi> it is a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bottome, and a dream which will deſtroy you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caſe</hi> 2. What a perſon ſhould do who (as yet) cannot certainly affirme <note place="margin">What a perſon ſhould do who as yet cannot certainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that Chriſt dyed for him.</note> that Chriſt dyed for him, and that he hath any intereſt in the benefits of his death?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This is the caſe of many troubled ſouls, and their exceeding burden and fear, unto whom I would commend, 1. A few Cautions. 2. A few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Cautions.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cautions to ſuch. Do not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiere your title.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Do not caſhiere your title.</hi> Though (all this while) you cannot clear your intereſt, although you cannot conclude for it, yet do not conclude againſt it, nor yet deſpair; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>This dark condition is incident to moſt</hi> (if not all) <hi>weak believers,</hi> who are baptized in a cloud, though they drink of the rock; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Chriſt indeed is theirs, although they do not ſee him to be theirs; and the blood of Chriſt was ſhed for them, although the aſſurance thereof be not ſhed abroad in their hearts; yea and pardon of their ſins is ſealed, although as yet it be not revealed to them; they do not finde this in a ſenſible experience, but yet they may finde all this in Gods promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Thy eſtate may be ſure, when as yet you are not aſſured.</hi> It may be day, though the Sun doth not gloriouſly appear; I confeſſe that faith of evidence makes our condition joyful; but yet the faith of adherence can make it ſure and bleſſed; for that is it which intereſts us into Chriſt, and Chriſt is he who intereſts

us into pardon and freedome; you ſhall be ſaved becauſe you are Chriſts, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know that you are ſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Though you have not your wages, yet do not give up your works;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Though you have not your wages, do not give over your work.</note> Do not ſay I will pray no more, and hear no more, and wait no longer; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may imagine, yet I aſſure you of this, it is nothing elſe but proud unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when God ſhall hear no longer from us, becauſe it is long before we hear from God, and we therefore leſſen duty, becauſe God is pleaſed to with-hold comforts. <label type="milestone">

                     <p>2. <hi>By careleſſe neglects;</hi> when a man will not take pains to recover loſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; it was the caſe of thoſe in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>I have put off my Coat, how ſhall I put it on?</hi>

If relations and titles to Chriſt, ſure they are not in me in truth! If Arguments to ſatisfie and ſettle the heart, O but I may not joyne with them! When a troubled ſinner is apt to joyne with all that will trouble, and to take part with all that will weaken his faith, and that will ſtrengthen his unbelief, and his great work lies in excepting, and in queſtioning, and in diſputing away his helps and encouragements to believe, this will hinder his aſſurance; that which hinders faith, will hinder aſſurance.</p>

                     <p>There are two choice works of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>1. One is to draw and perſwade the ſinner to come to Chriſt, to believe on him, to receive him.</p>
                     <p>2. The other is to aſſure the believer of his relation to Chriſt, and of Chriſts relation to him; that he is Chriſts, and that Chriſt is his; that he loved him, and gave himſelf for him: O pray, and continue this prayer, that the Spirit of Chriſt may be given unto you, to open and reveal all that is given to you, &amp;c.</p>

As a ſeal aſſures and confirms the matter contained and conveyed in a Deed, ſo doth the Sacrament confirme and aſſure weak believers of all the good of the Covenant, and of all the benefits purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt; that Ordinance is appointed only for believers; and it is appointed for this very end, to ſtrengthen their faith, and to breed aſſurance in them of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and communion with Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>2. <hi>Act your faith on Christ;</hi> glorifie him ſo far, as to venture on him alone for your pardon, for your peace, for your ſalvation; you know what he is, and what he hath done and ſuffered; and you know that your hearts are given up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and have choſen him to be your Lord Jeſus Chriſt: well (now) rely on him as yours, and on his blood as ſhed for the remiſſion of your ſins. Truſt him upon his Word which he hath ſpoken of all that believe on him, that they ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life; why, this is a faithful ſaying, I will caſt my ſelf upon him whom I have believed, I will truſt that in his Name, and by his blood God hath forgiven my ſins, and is reconciled to me, &amp;c. You would not imagine how much this would conduce to aſſurance.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a very nice queſtion, and I would warily ſpeak unto it; ſix things will be granted by us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That every believing perſon may attain unto this certain evidence;</hi> there are cauſes and means ſufficient to produce it; promiſes, faith, ſpirit, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That every believing perſon ſhould attain it;</hi> it is preſſed upon him in the Word, to ſtrive to make it ſure, and to come to the aſſurance of faith.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That God hath promiſed ſuch a knowledge unto all that are his in Covenant.</hi> Hoſea 2. 23. <hi>I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and I will ſay unto them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they ſhall ſay Thou art my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Church of Chriſt, and Believers both in the Old and in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (generally) have obtained unto this evidence; Doubtleſſe thou art our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Iſa. 63. 16. And <hi>O Lord thou art our Father; ſee we beſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi> Iſa. 64. 8, 9. <hi>Abraham, Job, David,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Canticles, my beloved is mine, and I am his; Paul,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Believers</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> they were <hi>ſealed,</hi> and had given unto them the <hi>earneſt of the ſpirit in their hearts:</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. The <hi>believing Epheſians</hi> had the like. <hi>In whom after ye belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance,</hi> Epheſ 1. 13. and of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, that the <hi>Goſpel came not in word only, but alſo in power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 5.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>There are many Believers among our ſelves who can ſay,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>he loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
                     </p>

Sixthly, <hi>There are many weak Believers who as yet cannot certainly ſay thus much,</hi> although they may <hi>ſafely</hi> ſay ſo much; for the weakeſt faith gives an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and therefore in his benefits.</p>
                     <p>Now for a direct anſwer to the caſe, I conceive that <hi>every true Believer effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Real;</hi> which is ſo much light, as indeed declares the truth of intereſt or relation; it over-tops actual doubtings in their prevalency; it turns the ſcale; it makes a ſoul to know thy faith is right, and Chriſt belongs to thee, and dyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for thee.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Gradual;</hi> which is like the Sun at Noon-day; there is ſuch an i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>luſtrious evidence of our relation unto, and propriety in Chriſt, that there is not only no fear or doubts, but alſo an abundant aſſurance and ſatisfaction that Chriſt is ours.

                        </gap>vices, or who are ſufferers for Chriſt; yet the former (ſome time or other) is the portion of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. Again, there is an aſſurance,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>More fixed and permanent,</hi> which abides and dwells with the ſoul for a long ſpace of time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>More quick and tranſient,</hi> which I would call a ſaluting aſſurance; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth give an hint by the Spirit of his love, and of his relation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in our mournings, ſometimes in our praying, ſometimes in our meditations, ſometimes in our hearings, Be of good comfort, Thy ſins are forgiven thee. And this revives the ſoul, but it doth not laſt long upon the ſoul. Though every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (for whom Chriſt dyed) perhaps attains not unto the permanent aſſurance; yet, I humbly conceive, that ſome time or other he doth to the tranſient aſſurance. Once more, there is an aſſurance,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Mediate</hi> by way of Argument, which is a concluſion from unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble premiſes; as thus, He that believes, ſhall be ſaved; and he that repents, ſhall be pardoned. Now a perſon throughly ſearching and weighing his condition by the Word and conſcience, finds full grounds that he believes, and that he repents; and therefore by an Argumentative faith and conſcience concludes certainly that his ſins are pardoned, and that his ſoul ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Immediate,</hi> by way of Illumination, when the Spirit of Chriſt lets in ſuch a brightneſſe of light, that we do plainly ſee all his workmanſhip of faith and grace in our hearts, and all our titles and relations to Chriſt; <label type="milestone">

                        </label> all appears in that perfect evidence, as the ſeveral colours do when the perfect light attends them. I would be underſtood in the former ſenſe, and not in the latter; ſo then this is the ſumme of my anſwer, that every true believer (ſome time or other of his life) doth attain unto ſome real aſſurance, though perhaps but weak and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and argumentative, and late.</p>

                        </label> The <hi>reaſons</hi> inducing me to this opinion, are theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Some aſſurance is neceſſary,</hi> though not <hi>to the abſolute being of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet unto his comfortable being,</hi> and unto the honour of the believing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the ſoul would faint and fail if it ſhould walk under perpetual ſilence and darkneſſe; but God will not ſuffer that; therefore ſome time or other he comforts the ſoul; and that comfort lies in this aſſurance of inte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſt in Chriſt, and in the benefits of his death.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The earneſt groans of the Spirit,</hi> and requeſts cauſally made by it <hi>are not in vain;</hi> for he makes <hi>requeſts according to the will of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 27. 1 Joh. 5. 14. which requeſt does certainly ſpeed firſt or laſt; but every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55323:177"/>
earneſtly prays for aſſurance; yea, Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 16. 23. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſhall ask, the Father in my Name he will give it you:</hi> ver. 24. <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full:</hi> Whence I infer, If the Father will give whatſoever we ask in the Name of Chriſt, then he will give us aſſurance. If we ſhall upon asking receive ſuch an anſwer, that our joy ſhall be full, then (ſome time or other) we ſhall receive this aſſurance; for upon this depends our joy and fulneſſe of joy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Some time or other, in this life every believer attains unto true peace of conſcience;</hi> (for 1. That is one portion bought for us by the blood of Chriſt to be enjoyed in this life. 2. That is expreſſely and often promiſed unto the people of God, he will ſpeak peace unto them, and will create the fruits of the lips, peace unto them. 3. Otherwiſe the renewed conſcience would be of as little comfort as the evil conſcience; but that peace of conſcience flows from ſome evidence that God is ſatisfied and reconciled unto us in Chriſt, and hath pardoned our ſins, and will ſave us; for if theſe things be not done, and if we in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure know them not to be done, conſcience cannot ſpeak peace unto us.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>God will not be wanting to any of his people in any means which may ſerve to draw out their love and praiſes:</hi> That God who expects our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and delights in our love, certainly will preſent unto us the beſt means for our love and praiſes. Now of all means whatſoever, for the quickning and drawing forth of theſe, none is comparable unto the aſſurance or certain knowledge that Chriſt is ours, and God is reconciled unto us in Chriſt, and hath for his ſake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The ſealing Ordinance of the Lords Supper</hi> is purpoſely inſtituted for to bring the believer in Chriſt to an aſſurance of his intereſt in the benefits of the death of Chriſt; and ſhall this never take effect in the believer for whoſe ſake it is inſtituted, and who is told in particular, This is my body which was broken for you? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. and given for you; <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. and This cup is the New Teſtament in my blood which is ſhed for you, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Nay, it would be very ſtrange that <hi>any Believer ſhould be interested in ſuch a choice love of God and Chriſt,</hi> and be brought into ſo <hi>near an union with Chriſt,</hi> as to be married unto him. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 19. and yet Chriſt ſhould never tell or aſſure him that he loves him; it is the nature of love to manifeſt it ſelf; and alſo into ſo <hi>gracious a communion</hi> with the Father and the Son, as to have <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. every day to converſe with them, and yet never know their love unto him. Moreover, that God the Father, and Chriſt his Son ſhould <hi>come unto him, and make their abode with him,</hi> Joh. 14. 23. and that Chriſt ſhould promiſe, <hi>He that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father,</hi> and <hi>I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him,</hi> ver. 21. and yet that this believing perſon ſhould never in all his life have any knowledge of this, eſpecially Chriſt aſſuring, <hi>all that I have known of the Father, I have made known unto you!</hi> Joh. 15. 15.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Let me adde one thing more, that <hi>a Believer ſhould have all the helps and cauſes apt and able to give him an aſſurance; (v. g.)</hi> all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, faith, a renewed conſcience, and the very Spirit of Chriſt, and yet all theſe ſhould lie dormant all his life long, and not give one word of aſſurance that he is Chriſts, or that Chriſt is his, and that God is reconciled to him; ſurely this doth not ſeem to be probable, eſpecially ſeeing the Believer is particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the tranſactions of Chriſt, and all thoſe tranſactions have a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto him. Nor do I know any ſolid objection to the contrary; for though many believers yet complain, and yet doubt, and yet ſeek for this aſſurance: Yet ſome of theſe may have had aſſurance, and purſue only an higher degree; or if they never yet had, yet they ſhall at length finde it; and their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeeking after it, are the means to attain to it.</p>

                        <hi>Caſe</hi> 4. Whether the <hi>aſſurance</hi> or certain knowledge that Chriſt is ours, <note place="margin">Whether aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him that hath it.</note> and dyed for our ſins, and made our peace, and purchaſed our ſalvation, <hi>be a matter of any ſpecial advantage unto him that hath it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I am willing to ſpeak ſomething to this caſe, becauſe it may ſerve much to excite the hearts of believing perſons to ſtrive after this aſſurance, when they ſhall hear the ſingular advantages and benefits thereby.</p>
                     <p>There are nine admirable advantages and benefits by it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>This aſſurance ſilenceth all the trouble of the ſoul,</hi> all the doubts and <note place="margin">Nine advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by it. It ſilenceth all trouble.</note> fears, and terrors, and ſad ſuſpitions, and apprehenſions in the ſoul; you are preſently off the Sea, and off the Rack, when this aſſurance comes; in the very nature of it, and in the inſeparable effects of it, it is a preſent cure and diſcharge unto all the anxiety and perplexity of the ſoul. Fears and doubts, and troubles of minde, may conſiſt with faith, but they cannot conſiſt with aſſurance; if I be once aſſured that Chriſt is mine, that he dyed for me, that my ſins are pardoned in his blood, my heart is preſently at eaſe, my conſcience ceaſeth to accuſe, God appears not as a Judge, but as a Father; all enmity is ſlain; what is there to fear or to trouble me? <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This aſſurance, as it ſilenceth all troubles, ſo <hi>it ſupplies the heart</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It ſupplies the heart with all comforts.</note> 
                        <hi>with all comforts; David</hi> ſpeaking of the light of Gods countenance, ſaith, that <hi>it put exceeding gladneſſe into his heart,</hi> Pſal. 4. 7. and <hi>made him to lie down in peace,</hi> ver. 8. Such comfortable operations come from this aſſurance of our intereſt in Chriſt, and in the benefits of his death; it makes us to <hi>rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious;</hi> and it produceth <hi>a peace that paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the reaſon of theſe comfortable effects, is this, becauſe the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans happineſſe, and of his propriety in it, neceſſarily fills the ſoul with joy and peace. <label type="milestone">

                        </label> When the Iſraelites were drawing towards the red Sea, they look't back upon their enemies, and were ſore afraid; but when they were paſt the red Sea, and look't back, and ſaw all their enemies drowned, they bowed, and bleſſed, and rejoyced; their ſighs were turned into joys, and their fears into peace, and they rejoyced exceedingly. Before aſſurance we look on our ſins, and fear; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance; when we ſee and know them to be drowned in the blood of Chriſt, now we rejoyce: God is reconciled, ſin is pardoned, my ſoul ſhall be ſaved; Doth not this, will not this cauſe us to rejoyce? <hi>We joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5. 11.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>This aſſurance doth quicken all our graces;</hi> it is their ſpring-time, <note place="margin">It quickens all our graces.</note> they act highly upon it, as <hi>Solomons garden of ſpices did when the South wind blew upon it,</hi> Cant. 4. 16.

And <hi>faith</hi> riſeth by it in ſtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and dependance upon God, whom I now know to love me, to be mine, to be reconciled unto me, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This aſſurance ſets on all our duties and ſervices with ſuch life,</hi>

                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>This aſſurance ſweetens all our other bleſſings;</hi> it is the Sugar in the <note place="margin">It ſweetens all other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> Wine; This land is mine, this houſe is mine, and this husband, and this wife, and theſe riches, this plenty, &amp;c. yea, and Chriſt is mine, and God is mine, and peace with God is mine, and forgiveneſſe of ſins, and ſalvation, and I know that they are mine! Although a man enjoys all theſe outward bleſſings, yet if his conſcience tells him Thou haſt no part in Chriſt, nor portion in his death, all thy ſins are unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Gods juſtice is unſatisfied, &amp;c. O what a ſinking is this unto him under all his abundance! or if a man be ſtill doubtful whether he hath a part in Chriſt, this imbitters all his poſſeſſions, I know not what will become of me at the laſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The Reaſons are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe his people have ſouls as well as bodies;</hi> and their ſouls do ſtand in as much need of ſpiritual bleſſings, as their bodies do of temporal bleſſings: Every mans ſoul (ſince the fall of <hi>Adùm)</hi> is in a fourfold miſerable neceſſity, which cannot be relieved but by ſpiritual bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>1. In an <hi>eſtate of ſpiritual death,</hi> out of which it cannot be relieved but by the donation of ſpiritual life; a quickning by the Spirit of Chriſt, is neceſſary for a ſoul dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
                     <p>2. In an <hi>eſtate of ſpiritual enmity;</hi> and that enmity cannot be ſlain but by the death of Chriſt; nor any atonement, peace or reconciliation enjoyed but by his blood.</p>
                     <p>3. In an <hi>eſtate of offence and guilt,</hi> which expoſe the ſoul unto wrath and puniſhment, by reaſon of which the ſoul needs exceeding riches of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to forgive and acquit the ſinner.</p>
                     <p>4. In an <hi>eſtate of pollution and bondage,</hi> being held under the power of ſinful luſts, in which regard the ſoul needs the Lord Jeſus to be redemption and liberty unto it, and the ſoul can never be freed nor free, but by Chriſt and his Spirit. <hi>John</hi> 8. 36. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Rom. 8. 2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death.</hi> If a man had all the bleſſings of the world, (riches, honour, friends, health, pleaſures, &amp;c.) they could be of no help or relief unto his ſoul at all; notwithſtanding all theſe, the ſoul ſtill remains ſinful and miſerable; Give the ſoul Chriſt, and grace, and mercy, or elſe you give it nothing; it muſt periſh for ever without them: And therefore doth God give unto his people ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, becauſe the ſoul needs them, and they are ſutable to the ſpiritual neceſſities of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>His people are people of another life,</hi> they have the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <note place="margin">His people are for another life.</note> life. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 25. <hi>This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life.</hi> Titus 1. 2. <hi>Inhope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, promiſed before the world began.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> But what of this, will you ſay? why, hence it follows that therefore God will give unto them ſpiritual bleſſings; and why ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings? becauſe ſpiritual bleſſings are neceſſary for them in relation unto that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other; for there is none other Name given under heaven, given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Loe here is a neceſſity of Jeſus Chriſt for our ſalvation. <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life; and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> Loe here is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of faith for ſalvation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Hebr. 12. 13. <hi>Follow holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Joh. 3. 3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> Loe here is a neceſſity of holineſſe and regeneration for ſalvation, and they are congruous, and fitting us for ſalvation or eternal life. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1 12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light.</hi> It is meet to enjoy grace, before we come to enjoy glory; it is meet to have a conformity to Chriſt on his Croſſe, before we come to have a conformity to Chriſt in his Crown, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>They are <hi>to deny themſelves,</hi> and to take up the Croſſe of Chriſt, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; they are to crucifie the luſts with the affections thereof; they are to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſſes and reproaches, and perſecutions, and perhaps death it ſelf; they are to fight the good fight of faith, to reſiſt temptation, to quench the fiery darts of Satan, to overcome the world; they are to live by faith, againſt hope to believe in hope, to walk in all well-pleaſing before the Lord.</p>
                     <p>They are <hi>to have daily communion with God,</hi> and their hearts are to be ſet on him, and on things above: Can any of theſe duties and ſervices be performed by them without ſpiritual ſtrength? or can they partake of ſpiritual ſtrength, unleſſe and untill God doth give unto them ſpiritual gifts or graces.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All the people in Covenant with God, <hi>they have his image reſtored</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">They have Gods image reſtored to them.</note> 
                        <hi>unto them, they behold as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. They are made <hi>partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. They are <hi>in Chriſt, and new creatures,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. They are a <hi>Choſen Generation,</hi> a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> an <hi>Holy Nation,</hi> a <hi>Peculiar People,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. A <hi>peculiar treaſure unto him,</hi> Exod. 19. 5. A people from whom he will <hi>with-hold no good thing,</hi> Pſal. 84. 11. Therefore unqueſtionably he will beſtow upon them ſpiritual gifts and bleſſings, and doth ſo, or elſe none of theſe things could be affirmed of them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>God will do more for his people in Covenant, then he will for any out of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God will do more for his people in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, than for any.</note> 
                        <hi>Covenant;</hi> (elſe what is the advantage of being in Covenant? or where is the ſtrength of Argument to perſwade any man to diſanul all other inconſiſtent Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and to ſubmit unto the Covenant of God, if he cannot better himſelf by being in this Covenant?) Now God doth give other things (temporal things, the things of, and for this life) many times to wicked men, to men out of Covenant; Thou <hi>filleſt their bellies with thy hid treaſure.</hi> And if his children (if the people of his Covenant who ſtand in near relation unto him) ſhould not have ſpiritual bleſſings and mercies given unto them, if they ſhould have (after all) but a common portion, gain little more then what the worſt of men (wicked men his enemies) have; what advantage ſhould they have? yea, thus it ſhould be all one with them, who love and fear God, and with them that hate him, and fear him not.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Whatſoever Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for the people of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>

                        <hi>that will God give unto them;</hi> (the purchaſes of Chriſt, and the promiſes, and performances of Gods Covenant are parallel) but Jeſus Chriſt hath by his death purchaſed all ſpiritual bleſſings; you cannot think of any one of them which Chriſt hath not purchaſed; they partake of Chriſt, and with and by him partake of all ſpiritual bleſſings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all spiritual bleſſings, in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55323:181"/>
only ſpiritual bleſſings do make the difference. Now this would be exceedingly abſurd that the people of God in Covenant with him, ſhould remain in the ſame ſtate of wickedneſſe and curſe, as people out of Covenant; this would be</p>
                     <p>1. A <hi>diſhonour to God,</hi> that he ſhould be a God in Covenant with ungodly and wicked perſons, and ſo continuing.</p>
                     <p>2. A <hi>diſhonour to his Covenant,</hi> which is a Covenant of love and mercy, and peace, and life, that God ſhould in a ſingular manner love the wicked, and aſſure mercy to them, and make peace with them, and give aſſurance of life and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto them.</p>

                        <hi>people of God,</hi> being ſenſible of their ſpiritual wants, and oft-times fearing, and doubting, and queſtioning ſpiritual helps and ſupplies.

                     <p>But I beſeech you hearken, and conſider four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Spiritual bleſſings are promiſed as well as temporal;</hi> that God who <note place="margin">Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as well as temporal.</note> promiſeth health, doth likewiſe promiſe grace; that God who promiſeth food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, doth likewiſe promiſe Chriſt; and that God who promiſeth deliverance from trouble, doth likewiſe promiſe deliverance from hell and wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>; and that God who promiſeth outward peace, doth likewiſe promiſe forgiveneſſe of ſins, and peace in conſcience; and that God who promiſeth to ſubdue enemies, doth likewiſe promiſe to ſubdue iniquities; and that God who promiſeth to give earth, doth likewiſe promiſe to give heaven. Is it nothing unto you that the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which your ſouls do need, are laid up, and are to be found in Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? if you had more faith, thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings which you find in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, you might quickly feel in your own hearts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>All spiritual bleſſings are promiſed;</hi> there is not any one ſpiritual bleſſing <note place="margin">All ſpiritual bleſſings are promiſed.</note> which any of the people of God do need, or may need, but God hath promiſed the ſame. Conſider ſpiritual bleſſings as in the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>cauſes,</hi> God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all of them: He hath promiſed <hi>glory,</hi> and he hath promiſed <hi>grace,</hi> and he hath promiſed himſelf, the cauſe of all: He hath promiſed all that belongs to faith, to Chriſt, to Juſtification; and he hath promiſed all that belongs to Converſion, to Sanctification, to Obedience, and to Comfort, and to Reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>God himſelf hath promiſed them;</hi> If Men or Angels had promiſed <note place="margin">God himſelf hath promiſed them.</note> them, it were nothing; for none of them are able to give any one ſpiritual bleſſing; the collating of the leaſt drop of grace and mercy, and inward peace is above the power of any creature; but this is the comfort, that God himſelf hath promiſed to give all ſpiritual bleſſings unto his people, I ſay God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>1. Who is <hi>able to performe</hi> and make good whatſoever he hath promiſed; Is any thing too hard for him? is not his power more then commenſurate with his Word? is he not ſufficient to do what he ſpeaks? he is mercifulneſſe it ſelf, and holineſſe it ſelf, and life it ſelf, and bleſſedneſſe it ſelf; is not the God of all grace able to give you grace? is not the God of all power able to ſubdue your iniquities? is not the God of all mercy able to forgive? is not the God of all comfortable to comfort you? is not the God of peace able to ſpeak peace?</p>
                     <p>2. Who is <hi>willing to do good in his promiſes:</hi> I beſeech you, what are Gods promiſes, but the expreſſions of his gracious will concerning us, in all the good which he purpoſeth to confer upon us? I will bleſſe, I will heal, I will ſhew mercy, I will ſave, I will pardon, I will give grace and glory, I will hear and help, I will do you good, theſe are the very ingredients of his promiſes; the promiſes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the good will and purpoſe of God tranſcribed and copied out for us.</p>

3. <hi>Who is faithful,</hi> Hebr. 11. 11. <hi>Sarah judged him faithful who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> and what is it for God to be faithful in his promiſes, but in his own good time to do what he ſpeaks, and to give what he promiſeth to give! <hi>Faithful is he who hath called you, who will alſo do it;</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 24.

                     <p>Object. <hi>Pray unto him will you ſay? if he hath promiſed to give them, what need we to pray for them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Yes, promiſes on Gods part, and prayers on our part are not contradiſtinct, but ſubordinate: therefore remember</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Though God promiſeth to give</hi> all theſe ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>yet he</hi> expreſly <hi>calls for prayer</hi> from us unto himſelf, to beſtow them on us. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> Jer. 29. 11. <hi>I know the thoughts that I think towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>Then ſhall you call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>And ye ſhall ſeek me and finde me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. As he calls for prayer, ſo <hi>he adds a new engagement of promiſe</hi> to give (even ſpiritnal bleſſings) upon prayer. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Your heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi>
                     </p>

his Word of promiſe? and can he do this or that? the Lord humble our hearts for this; we think not of it as a ſin, or elſe but a ſmall ſin; but indeed it is an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly provoking ſin and an eternal diſhonour to the God of truth and mercy, thus by our unbelief to charge a lye, or a doubtfulneſſe upon him.</p>

                     <p>But two things befall theſe men. 1. Either they die in the time of their Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly projects and deſigns: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p n="2">2. Who think only of Spiritual bleſsings, when they muſt part with all their temporal bleſsings, and that is when they come to die; O then a Chriſt, and then peace with God and then mercies to pardon their ſins, and then grace to believe and repent; and thus they put off looking after Spiritual bleſſings, untill they have no time to get them; or elſe God will not give theſe Spiritual bleſsings in the time which they now do ſet, becauſe they ſlighted and neglected them in the time when God was pleaſed to offer them.</p>
                     <p>Now what ſhall I ſay to theſe men? Is it probable or poſsible to awaken them to receive inſtruction! I will make bold to tell you three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>As yet they are not in Covenant with God:</hi> For every one actually and ſincerely Covenanting with God, his heart is ſet on God as his firſtand as his beſt, and his full, and his only portion: <hi>Thou art my portion O Lord.</hi> Pſal. 119. 57. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are perſons of vain and fooliſh hearts; what a vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is to pitch on vain things on Earth, when God offers firſt the great things of Heaven! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. Suppoſe a goodly Inheritance (worth 1000. l. <hi>per annum)</hi> were offered, and a few Counters were alſo offered, or only 10. l. <hi>per annum</hi> for life, were he not a vain and fooliſh man, who would fix his choice on the laſt offer? So when God offers all Spiritual bleſſings firſt, and next the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which are only for term of life; then like the <hi>Prodigal</hi> for the preſent time to have a little Earthly portion in our hands, &amp;c. or like <hi>Eſau</hi> to prefer a <hi>Meſſe of Pottage before the birth-right,</hi> how vain is this!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you do not infallibly undo your ſouls, yet you do extreamly hazard them, you do expoſe them to a moſt dangerous contingency: For ſuppoſe you do intend hereafter to mind and get Spiritual bleſſings, yet what if God ſhould cut you off in the midſt of your dayes! what if in the depth of your labour for Earth, he ſhould command you to return to the Earth, and perhaps ſuddenly and in a moment, what now would become of your poor ſouls! <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoule be taken from thee; then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be?</hi> Luke 12. 20. <hi>And what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, if he ſhall loſe his ſoule!</hi> Matth. 16. 26.</p>

Matth. 6. 31, 32. <hi>Take no thought what ye ſhall eat; for after all theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek.</hi> Earthly things are a common ſtock, only Spiritual bleſſings are the Childrens inheritance: As God ſpake of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that <hi>they ſhall have no inheritance among their brethren, I will be their portion,</hi> ſaid the Lord; ſo may we ſay of temporal and Spiritual bleſſings, God will not have his people to ſit down with ſo low and poor a portion as temporal things, but their portion ſhall be himſelf, his Chriſt, his Spirit, his Grace, his Peace, his Joy, his Glory, his Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                     <p>3. And thoſe are <hi>the beſt portions:</hi> Theſe do make up our eſtate indeed: now you may ſit down and rejoyce, for you have poſſeſſion good enough, and ſafe enough: and a better poſſeſſion than God himſelf, and all Spiritual bleſings no ſoul is capable of.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Reaſons thereof are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>No creature whatſoever can give them;</hi> therefore it belongs to God alone: Two things (at the leaſt) are required for the giving of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. <note place="margin">No Creature can give them.</note>
                     </p>

1. One is <hi>Authority;</hi> there muſt be a right in them as ours; for what hath any one to do to give that which is none of his?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> or ability to paſs them over unto another, and to make the bleſsings to be his: Now no creature hath <hi>Authority</hi> to give any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; why ſo! becauſe God only is the Lord of all bleſsings whatſoever, they are his, and of right belong unto him only: Conſider, all ſorts of bleſsings they are his, he is the Lord of them. <hi>Spiritual bleſſings</hi> are his, mercy is his, he is the God of mercy; and grace is his, he is the God of all grace; and comfort is his, he is the God of all conſolation; and peace is his; he is the very God of peace; and love is his, <hi>God is love;</hi> the Spirit is his, and Chriſt is his Anointed; and glory is his, he is the God of glory. And ſo for <hi>temporal bleſſings,</hi> though they be ours many times for poſſeſsion and uſe, yet they are his for Right and Donation. <hi>The earth is the Lords and the fulneſſe thereof,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 24. 1. <hi>Thine (O Lord) is the greatneſſe, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the Majeſty; for all that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine,</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 11. <hi>Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all,</hi> ver. 12. And no Creature hath <hi>Sufficiency</hi> or <hi>Ability</hi> to convey or paſſe over bleſsings; for <hi>Spiritual bleſſings,</hi> can any man give them unto himſelf, or unto another? Can any man give <hi>faith</hi> unto himſelf? <hi>It is the work of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; it is the <hi>gift of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> Can any man give <hi>Repentance</hi> unto himſelf, no, it was <hi>God that gave repentance unto the Gentiles;</hi> and the Church prayed, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned:</hi> Can any man make his own heart <hi>holy?</hi> no, it is <hi>God</hi> himſelf <hi>which ſanctifies us:</hi> can any man <hi>forgive his own ſinnes?</hi> no, <hi>who can forgive ſinnes but God only?</hi> And for <hi>temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> can we give rain, or plenty, or ſafety, or health, or life, or eaſe; or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs? can we make the Cloudes to drop down, or the ſword to be at reſt, or the ſick to be at reſt? No Creature can do any thing of itſelf; and therefore God himſelf undertakes to give all the bleſsings in the Covenant unto his people; otherwiſe they could never have them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God will have the glory of whatſoever bleſſing we do receive from him:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God will have the glory of all our bleſſings.</note> He allows unto us the benefit of them, and the comfort of them; but he reſerves all the glory of them unto himſelf alone: <hi>Thine is the glory,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; Matth. 6. 13.</p>
                     <p>Now upon a double account doth the glory of all apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to God, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that he is the <hi>End</hi> of all his works, and gifts, and bleſsings; all that God manifeſts about the ſalvation of ſinners, is to the <hi>praiſe and glory of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. He himſelf is the ultimate End of all his works, and of himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In that he is the <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> of all good and bleſsings; the Apoſtle joynes theſe two together, in Rom. 11. 16. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> Mark the place, let glory be given to God for ever, and unto him alone; why ſo! becauſe, 1. All things are of him, and through him, he is the Efficient Cauſe; 2ly. All things are to him, he is the Final Cauſe for which they are: You have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place to this purpoſe, in 1 Cor. 1. 30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> ver. 31. <hi>That according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Lord.</hi> If any man could be of himſelf, the cauſe unto himſelf of any good, then he might glory in himſelf, and bleſs himſelf and ſay, This hath mine own hand wrough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for me, I gave life unto my ſelf, and grace to my heart, and peace to mine own conſcience, and I wrought mine own Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No, ſaith the Apoſtle, you can do nothing, it is of God that ye are in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55323:186"/>
Chriſt, and it is of God that Chriſt is made unto you wiſdom, &amp;c. therefore you may not glory in your ſelves, but only in the Lord. If I be made high only by the favour of another, and if I be made rich only by the bounty of another, ſhould I give the glory of theſe unto my ſelf? well then, God hath a right unto all glory, therefore he himſelf will give all grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God himſelf undertakes to give unto his people all Covenant-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, <note place="margin">God would have the hearts of his people f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>becauſe the hearts of his people ſhould be fixed and faſtened on him alone:</hi> There are two things which God cannot endure, eſpecially in his own people.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is a <hi>diſtruſt of himſelf; Why ſayeſt thou O Jacob, and ſpeakeſt O Iſrael, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſſed over from my God!</hi> Iſa. 40. 27.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is, a <hi>truſting upon the creature;</hi> and now <hi>What haſt thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Siber! Or what haſt thou to do with the way of Aſſyria, to drink the water of the River!</hi> Jer. 2. 18. <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and whoſe heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from the Lord,</hi> Jer. 17. 5. No, but this is it that the Lord doth require of his people; <hi>viz.</hi> to take off their hearts (their hopes and expectations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances) from all other beſides himſelf, and to ſettle and fix them only upon himſelf. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. <hi>Look unto me all ye ends of the earth, and be ſaved; for I am God, and there is none elſe.</hi> Pſal. 62. 8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, poure out the heart before him; God is a refuge, Selah.</hi> In the Covenant God engageth his heart to us; and one reaſon thereof, is, to engage our hearts to him; in the Covenant he engageth his power and goodneſſe, and all-ſufficiency, and fidelity unto us; and this he doth to engage our love to him, our fear to him, our hope and confidence unto him; this is enough, God himſelf undertakes for all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>That faith might have a ſure foundation;</hi> this I take for unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable; <note place="margin">That faith may have a ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. True faith cannot be raiſed but by a Divine power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. True faith cannot reſt upon any mutable or inſufficient power; you may as ſoon fix an Anchor in the Aire, as to make faith faſten upon impotent and weak cauſes; if we do certainly know that ſuch an Object or Agent cannot help, or will not help, that it fails in ſufficiency of power, or kindneſſe of will, or ſtedfaſtneſſe of being faith cannot draw out the heart to truſt and ſay, Here you are ſure to find mercy, and ſure to find love, and ſure to find help, and ſure ſtill to find ſupply; faith muſt have a ſure Anchor to truſt unto, or elſe it can never quiet the heart; and elſe it can never perſwade the heart to reſt, or to expect, or wait; but now becauſe God himſelf undertakes to give unto his people all good which concerns them, faith hath foundation ſure enough to build upon; for there cannot be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity than God himſelf, binding and engaging himſelf unto us. God is an all-ſufficient goodneſſe, wiſdom, kindneſſe, omnipotency, immutability, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all this is in a way of Covenant unto you; faith cannot deſire ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or greater, or ſurer grounds to draw out the heart to truſt, than theſe; theſe are ſufficient to anſwer all fears and doubts, and temptations, and contrary ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, laſtly, <hi>To whom ought we to pray for all the good which we do need?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>even to God alone;</hi> he calls upon us to call only upon him; Call upon me, and ask of me; and I will be enquired of to do this for them; and poure out your heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: Certainly then God himſelf doth undertake to give all, if he alone will be ſought unto for all; if there were any thing which he could not do, or would not do, or that others alſo beſides himſelf were to do for us, then he would not have reſtrained our prayers to himſelf alone; but becauſe he doth bound and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine all our prayers at all times unto himſelf alone, therefore unqueſtionably it is

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That God undertakes in his Coventnt to give unto his people all the good which they do or ſhall need;</hi> not all good ſimply, not all good whatſoever that can be deſired, but all good which is proper for them, and needful for them; ſo far as the Covenant goes or extends to any perſon, ſo far doth Gods undertaking to give extend: Now his Covenant is for all that is good for you, <hi>No good thing will he with-hold,</hi> Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 84. 11. <label type="milestone">

                        <note place="margin">God gives all needful good aſſuredly.</note> 2. <hi>That whatſoever good is needful, that God doth undertake to give you aſſuredly;</hi> for you have his bond of promiſe, and his oath likewiſe; he doth ſo undertake to give it, that you ſhall not miſſe of it, but ſhall certainly enjoy it; not only the ſubſtantially ſpiritual bleſſings, (which make up the <hi>eſſe</hi> of an heavenly conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but alſo thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings circumſtantially conſidered in the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of it, (as ſpiritual joy and peace, and aſſurance) when your ſouls come into ſuch an exigence that theſe are neceſſary for you, you ſhall not miſſe of them; when your child is weak and ſinking, the father will give him the cordial; as when he is hungry, he will give him the food; Nay, not only ſpiritual bleſſings, but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals alſo; there is a certainty of them, when there is a neceſſity of them: <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them,</hi> Iſa. 41. 17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That when it is affirmed that God undertakes to give all bleſſings unto his <note place="margin">God will give all in his own time.</note> people in Covenant, this muſt be underſtood <hi>in his own time;</hi> there are our times, and Gods times; Gods time is called the <hi>time appointed,</hi> Habakkuk 2. 3. and the <hi>acceptable time,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2. and the <hi>time of the promiſe,</hi> Acts 7. 17. Now though God will give all neceſſary good unto his people, yet he will do this, not at our time, but at his own time; for 1. He is a gracio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Again, ſpiritual bleſſings, ſome of them are of <hi>a vital conſequence,</hi> which make the ſoul alive, and the condition of it truly good; all theſe God gives together at one time; he gives faith and Chriſt, and Juſtification, and Sanctification all at once; as ſoon as the perſon believes he is united to Chriſt, and hereupon juſtified and ſanctified. And others of them are of a <hi>comfortable conſequence,</hi> as aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, joy, peace, &amp;c. God doth not give theſe bleſſings firſt of all; but after he hath given the former. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom after ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe;</hi> (mark, the ſealing follows the believing) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>In whom believing ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory;</hi> (here rejoycing follows believing) <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God;</hi> (peace with God follows juſtification) and therefore is it a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe for any troubled ſouls, to preſſe God, or to expect from God the comforts and joys, and aſſurances promiſed, before they have faith, and are in Chriſt; for though God doth promiſe theſe things, yet he promiſes to give them in an orderly way; the graces firſt, and then the comforts of grace; faith and union with Chriſt firſt, and then the joys and peace depending upon that union.</p>
                     <p>5. When God undertakes to give all bleſſings unto his people in Covenant, this <note place="margin">He gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportions and meaſures he knows beſt for us in our places and conditions.</note> muſt be underſtood <hi>according to the proportion and meaſure which he knows beſt for us in our places and conditions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a <hi>meaſure of apprehenſion of Chriſt,</hi> and of our juſtification by Chriſt, and of our ſalvation by Chriſt; God gives a greater and clearer, and more fixed meaſure of the apprehenſion or reflexive knowledge of theſe to ſome of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then he doth to others of them. And there is a <hi>meaſure of holineſſe;</hi> ſome have higher, and ſome have weaker degrees of grace; now in Gods undertaking to give all ſpiritual bleſſings, you muſt not think that God intends to give every meaſure or degree of grace at once, nor yet the like degree of grace unto every one, nor yet the like meaſure of comfortable evidences, or apprehenſions of intereſt in Chriſt, and remiſſion, and ſalvation by him; no, but God will give all Covenant-bleſſings unto all his people in ſuch a proportion and meaſure, in this life, as may conduce moſt to his glory, and may moſt fit them in their private and publick conditions for his better ſervice.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. VVHat is forgiveneſs of ſins? and wherein doth it conſiſt? <note place="margin">Forgiveneſſe of ſins deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> Sol. <hi>It is a gracious act or work of God for Chriſts ſake, diſcharging and abſolving believing and repenting perſons, from the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſinnes, ſo that God is no longer diſpleaſed with them: nor will he ever remember them any more, nor call them to an account, and condemn them for their ſinnes, but will look on them, and will deale with them as if they had never offended him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we muſt pauſe awhile, and conſider ſix things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is a gracious act of God;</hi> there be ſome acts <note place="margin">It is a gracious act of God.</note> of God which have a ſpecial reference unto his power, as the Creation of the world, and the reſurrection of the dead. There be other acts of God which have a ſpecial reference unto his Juſtice; as the condemnation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of unbelieving and impenitent ſinners. And there are ſome acts of God which have a ſpecial reference unto his meer goodneſs, and graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there being no Reaſon or Cauſe of them on our parts; ſuch an act is his Remiſſion or forgiveneſs of our ſins. Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my Name ſake.</hi> Eph. 1. 7. <hi>The forgiveneſſe of ſins ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his grace.</hi> Pſal. 51. 1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy loving kindneſſe, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions.</hi> Rom. 3. 25. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not that <hi>Repentance</hi> is not required in the ſinner who is to be pardoned: For the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly of a <hi>turning from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that we may receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> Acts 26. 18. Not that <hi>Believing</hi> is not required in the ſinner to be forgiven; for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith alſo expreſly, <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 10. 43. but becauſe theſe are not Reaſons or meritorious cauſes for whoſe ſake God doth forgive any man his ſins; they declare the effect who are pardoned, not the cauſe why they are pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſinnes hath foundation in Chriſt (and in him only)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It hath founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</note> as the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> thereof. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion.</hi> Matth. 26. 28. <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for many, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>In his blood we have redemption, even the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 12. <hi>I write unto you little children, becauſe your ſins are forgiven you for his Names ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Forgiveneſs of ſins hath a double reſpect:</p>
                     <p>One unto <hi>our ſelves;</hi> ſo it comes unto us freely from the grace of God as a free gift.</p>
                     <p>Another unto <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo it comes by way of purchaſe and merit; it doth coſt us nothing; but it did coſt Jeſus Chriſt his precious blood to obtain the remiſſion of our ſins, and to make peace for us.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt comes in as the cauſe of forgiveneſſe, upon a twofold account.</p>
                     <p>One in reſpect <hi>of God,</hi> whoſe juſtice muſt be ſatisfieds, that ſo his mercy (if I may ſo phraſe it) may be ſet at liberty to flow out unto ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Another in reſpect of <hi>us,</hi> that we may come with the more boldneſs and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to obtain forgiving mercy in the name of Chriſt, it being the very mercy which he by his blood purchaſed for us at the hands of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſins is limited to repenting and believing perſons;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is limited to repenting and believing perſons.</note> theſe and theſe only are the ſubjects of that precious mercy unto whom it doth belong</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:55323:192"/>
There are three ſorts of creatures and perſons in the world:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some of whom you read, that <hi>they ſhall never be forgiven;</hi> the <hi>Divels</hi> ſhall never have their ſins forgiven, but are held and <hi>reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſſe, unto the judgement of the great day,</hi> Jude, ver. 6. And they who <hi>ſin the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſhall never be forgiven. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 31. <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>And whoſoever speaketh a word againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him, but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> it ſhall not <hi>be forgiven him neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some to whom forgiveneſs <hi>is conditionally offered,</hi> but they do refuſe it upon that condition; ſuch are all impenitent and unbelieving perſons, who living under the Goſpel, are called upon to leave their ſins, and are aſſured if they do ſo, that they ſhall find mercy to pardon their ſins; but for lying vanities they forſake their mercies; and becauſe they love their ſins, therefore they do loſe the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some who <hi>penitentially come off from their ſins, and believingly come unto Chriſt;</hi> they put off their ſins by repentance, and put on Chriſt by faith; theſe are they who find mercy, to whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Be of good comfort, your ſins are forgiven.</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall finde mercy.</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified;</hi> but as for the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they <hi>treaſure up wrath unto themſelves,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. The unbelievers, they <hi>are condemned already,</hi> John 3. 18. and the <hi>wrath of God abideth on them,</hi> Ver. 36.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Forgiveneſs of ſins conſiſteth in the <hi>diſcharging or abſolving of a</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It conſiſteth in diſcharging of a ſinner from guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is the diſcharging, abſolving, remitting, freeing, diſmitting, ſparing of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the phraſes in Scripture (for the forgiving of ſins) are very ſignificant, both in the Old Teſtament, and in the New. In the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> there are words uſed for the forgiveneſs of ſins, which import what I affirm.</p>

                     <p>Now there are three things conſiderable in our ſins; there is</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Macula,</hi> the ſtain or pollution of it; for ſin doth pollute and defile the ſoul, therefore it is frequently ſtiled a pollution, a defilement, uncleanneſs, filthineſs, a plague, a leproſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Reatus,</hi> the guilt by it; for as ſoon as any man doth ſin, there is a guilt upon him, by which he is bound over to the wrath and curſe of God; and this guilt or obligation is inſeparable from ſin; the ſin doth deſerve no leſs than everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Pana,</hi> the puniſhment of it, which conſiſts in the inflicting of all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that ſin doth deſerve, and which God hath threatned for tranſgreſſing his holy and righteous will. <note place="margin">What it is in ſin the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin doth reſpect.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>The queſtion is, unto which of theſe forgiveneſſe of ſins doth extend? of from which of theſe the ſinner is diſcharged upon forgiveneſs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer:</p>
                     <p>1. Forgiveneſs of ſins doth not reſpect <hi>the ſtain or pollution of ſin,</hi> it doth <note place="margin">Not the ſtain or pollution of it.</note> not remove that; it is an idle opinion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and others, that remiſſion of ſins conſiſts in the extinction of ſins, or utter abolition of them; <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> for</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This is to <hi>confound Juſtification with Sanctification;</hi> it being proper to Sanctification to remove and take a way the ſtain and pollution of ſin in the ſoul; that is the Fullers ſope and refining fire.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The utter deletion of ſin is not granted in this life;</hi> (for during this life, ſin remaineh in the beſt of men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17, 20. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us;)</hi> but in this life we have the remiſſion of our ſins; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Remiſsion of ſin maketh (formally) no change in the perſon forgiven.</hi> for it is a work without him; indeed there is a <hi>relative change</hi> upon forgiveneſs; (the perſon forgiven is in a ſtate of life, and not of death) but there is no <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent change</hi> of qualities in the perſon by it; (no more than there is in a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor pardoned, or a Debtor forgiven; both of them may be diſeaſed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their pardon) but this could not be, if remiſſion of ſin conſiſted in the extinction or deletion of the ſtain of ſin. It is true, that when God forgives the ſin, he doth likewiſe change the heart of the ſinner; nevertheleſs the forgiving of ſin is one thing, and the giving of a new heart is another thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If remiſſion of ſin conſiſt in the outward deletion of ſin, <hi>Then the troubled conſcience could never come to reſt and peace in the aſſurance of pardon of ſin;</hi> why? becauſe in this life the perſon ſhall never find in himſelf ſuch an utter deletion of ſin, and conſequently no remiſſion of ſins; and if no remiſſion of ſin, then no reſt, nor peace; becauſe from the knowledge and aſſurance of that doth the reſt and peace of conſcience come and flow.</p>
                     <p>2. Forgiveneſs of ſins hath a <hi>peculiar reſpect to the guilt of ſin, and removal</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reſpect to the guilt of ſin.</note> 
                        <hi>of that;</hi> when the Lord forgives a man, he doth diſcharge him of that obligation by which he was bound over to wrath and condemnation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Ver. 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that justifieth.</hi> Ver. 34. <hi>Who is</hi>
                        <pb n="363" facs="tcp:55323:193"/>
                        <hi>he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> Beloved, the Lord is a holy and juſt God, and he reveals his wrath from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe, and there is a curſe threatned to every <hi>tranſgreſsion of the Law;</hi> and when any man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, he is obnoxious unto the curſe, and God may inflict the ſame upon him; but when God forgives ſins, he therein doth interpoſe (as it were) between the ſin and the curſe, and between the obligation and the condemnation, <hi>q. d.</hi> by reaſon of your ſinning you are now fallen into my hands of juſtice, and for your ſinning I may according to my righteous Law condemn and curſe you for ever; (for by your ſinning you <hi>are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1. 32.) but ſuch is my mercy to you in Chriſt, that for his ſake I will ſpare you; and that curſe and condemnation which you have deſerved, it ſhall never light upon you; I will deliver and free your ſouls from going down into the pit.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But may ſome ſay, Is not guilt inſeparable from ſin? can ſin be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guilt? and can guilt be without the deſert of wrath and condemnation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, there is a two-fold guilt; there is <hi>reatus ſimplex,</hi> and <hi>reatus efficax; abſolute guilt</hi> hath in it a worthineſs or deſert of condemnation, and this can never be ſeparated from ſin; (for though ſin be pardoned, and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion removed from the ſinner, yet his ſin is worthy of condemnation) but when God pardons ſin, he doth it not by making the ſin not to be worthy of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but this is it which God doth, he doth remove that condemnation that it ſhall never effectually or actually fall upon the ſinner, although he for his ſinning be worthy thereof; <hi>e. g.</hi> When a thief or murderer is pardoned amongſt us, this pardon doth not make the theft or murder no ſin, or in themſelves not worthy of death by the Law; but it relieves the pardoned perſons thus far, that the death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by theſe ſins is taken off, and ſhall never be inflicted on the offenders.</p>
                     <p>3. Forgiveneſs of ſin <hi>takes off all puniſhments properly ſo called;</hi> for ſin, there <note place="margin">It takes off all puniſhment properly ſo called.</note> belongs unto us temporal puniſhment, and eternal puniſhment; you do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a depth of merit there is in ſin, what plagues and curſes it can pull down in this life, and what an hell hereafter; but when God forgives ſins, you are then releaſed, and for ever acquitted from any after-reckonings with the juſtice of God; Divine juſtice hath no more to ſay or do againſt you; for <hi>remiſſa culpa, remittitur poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> if the fault be forgiven then alſo is the puniſhment forgiven; nay, let me ſpeak with an humble reverence, God cannot in his juſtice puniſh when he hath pardoned. Why will you ſay?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He forgives upon a ſatisfaction made to his juſtice already by Chriſt, ſo that he cannot in juſtice puniſh us again for ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When he forgives, he releaſes the guilt and the fault, and the ſin in now (by this act of his merciful grace) as if it had never been committed; ſo that the proper cauſe and reaſon of puniſhing being utterly removed, there can no puniſhment iſſue out from Divine juſtice againſt you.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But will ſome ſay, are not juſtified and pardoned perſons many times puniſhed in this life? Was not</hi> David <hi>puniſhed for his ſin? were not the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>puniſhed for their unworthy receiving of the Lords Supper?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, that word Puniſhment may be taken, either</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Largely,</hi> for any affliction or chaſtiſement which doth befall us from God as a Father; in this ſenſe I grant puniſhment incident to juſtified or pardoned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth.</hi> And, Ver. 7. <hi>If you endure chaſtiſement, God dealeth with you as with ſons; for what ſon is he whom the Father chaſtneth not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Strictly,</hi> for thoſe miſerable evils iſſuing out from the Court of juſtice, and falling upon us from God as a wrathful Judge, and as yet unſatisfied and unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; theſe kinds of puniſhing are wholly and utterly removed from juſtified or pardoned perſons by the blood of Chriſt, and Gods gracious forgiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>5. A fifth thing conſidered in the deſcription of forgiveneſs of ſins, is this, <note place="margin">It is Gods act of oblivion.</note>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:55323:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that forgiveneſs of ſins is (if I may ſo expreſs it) <hi>Gods act of oblivion;</hi> and as it were, an eternal cancelling of all our ſinful bonds and debts, ſo that there is now a full end of all controverſies between God and us.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>We many times are poſſeſſed with fears, like</hi> Joſephs Brethren, <hi>that notwithſtanding the peace and aſſurance which he gave them of paſsing by their injurious dealing with him, yet at length they feared that he would remember them, and be avenged of them; ſuch thoughts have we of God alſo; ſometimes we do perceive his great love and rich mercy towards us in the forgiveneſs of our ſins; yet at other times we have fears leſt God will call us unto account for all our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful offences, and queſtion us, and judge us, as if the granting of pardoning mercy might be revoked and called back by the Writ of Error, and the old ſuit be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted again by Divine juſtice, which ſeemeth to be taken off and ſilenced by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But Beloved, there is no ſuch matter, and no ſuch dealing of God with us; the ſinner may <hi>provocare,</hi> he may appeal from the Court of juſtice, unto the Throne of Gods mercy; and of this he may reſt aſſured, that the definitive ſentence in the Court of mercy about the forgiveneſs of ſins, is like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which ſtood faſt for ever, and remains unchangeable: And as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſpake of his bleſſing of <hi>Jacob, I have bleſſed him, and he ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> that may we affirme of Gods forgiving any ſinner, he hath forgiven him, and he ſhall for ever continue forgiven; and the Scriptures give full teſtimony unto this which I now deliver unto you. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>The iniquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not be ſound; for I will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi> Ezek. 18. 22. <hi>All his tranſgreſsions which he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him;</hi> q. d. I will never ſpeak of them any more. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their ſin no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And beſides theſe places, there are three other which (though metaphorically, yet) do notably expreſs the eternal paſſing over ſin in Gods forgiveneſs of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſsions for mine own ſake.</hi> Here our ſins are compared to <hi>debts</hi> written in a book; and Gods forgiving of them is compared to the blotting of them out of the book; if a debt-book be croſſed, this would much ſatisfie us; (for that ſuppoſeth a diſcharge) but if the debt be blotted out, now it can never be read againſt us any more, it is utterly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and nothing of a debt can be made to appear. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depth of the Sea:</hi> If a man be caſt upon the Sea, or into the Sea, yet he may recover again; but if he be caſt into the depths of the Sea, into the very <hi>profundum</hi> of it, he is drowned and gone; the meaning of the place is, that when God forgives the ſins of his people, they ſhall never riſe up and appear before him again; you have a phraſe (for the effect of this) concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18. 21. <hi>A mighty Angel took up a ſtone, and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, thus with violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall never be found no more at all.</hi> And in this reſpect often God is ſaid to caſt our ſins into the depths of the Sea; his meaning is, they ſhall be like men that lie drowned and buried in the bottome of the Sea; and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Having ſlain the enmity thereby;</hi> the enmity here (principally meant) is ſin, but this by the blood of Chriſt is ſlain: Mark, he doth not ſay it is impriſoned, nor it is wounded, but it is <hi>ſlain,</hi> killed out, right; thus when God in the blood of Chriſt forgives our ſins, they are (as it were) ſlain, they dye, and ceaſe to be, and can never raiſe a quarrel or variance more between God and us.</p>
                     <p>6. What ſhall I ſay more, when God forgives any man his ſins, <hi>all diſpleaſure</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Upon forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note> 
                        <hi>ceaſeth;</hi> the forgiven party is now looked upon, and received with that love and favour, as if he had never offended God, and as if God had never been offended by him.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It is a very truth, and worthy to be believed and received with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acceptation. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 4. <hi>I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from him;</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Iſrael</hi> prays for the forgiveneſs of ſin; <hi>(take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly)</hi> this petition God heard and granted; and now obſerve in what a poſture God appears toward them, not of diſpleaſure or anger, <hi>(mine anger is turned away from him)</hi> but of kindneſs and favour, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der love; <hi>(I will love him freely)</hi> Iſa. 54. 8. <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord, thy Redeemer.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>For this is as the water of Noah unto me; for as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhould no more go over the earth, ſo have I ſworn that I would not be wrath with thee, nor rebuke thee.</hi> Luk 15. 21. <hi>And the ſon ſaid unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>But the Father ſaid unto his ſervants, bring forth the beſt robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and ſhooes on his feet.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>And bring hither the fatted Calf, and kill, and let us eat, and be merry.</hi> Here the ſins of the Prodigal are pardoned, and his father receives him with ſuch expreſſions of love and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and familiarity, as if he had never ſinned againſt him: Hence it is that you read of ſuch ſweet, kind, tender, loving, comforting expreſſions of God towards thoſe whoſe ſins he hath pardoned. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 16. <hi>Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child?</hi> Matth. 9. 2. <hi>Son, Be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>

                     <p>4. By <hi>the examples</hi> of the beſt men, ſinning <hi>Noah, Lot, Abraham, Jacob, Moſes, David, Jehoſhaphat, Peter,</hi> and all theſe when they were in a juſtified condition.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Experience;</hi> What one child of God hath there been, or is there in the world, who doth not find much ſin dwelling in him, although he be delivered from the condemnation of ſin! <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. and from the dominion of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. Yet he is not perfectly in this life delivered from the inhabitation of ſin, and motions, and conflicts, and actions of ſin. If any of us (who indeed are in Chriſt, and juſtified by him) have ever ſurveyed the cleareſt and faireſt day of our life, (when our hearts have been moſt enlarged, and our feet moſt upheld) we ſhall with all our good find a great mixture of evil, ſo that we daily ſee as much cauſe to mourn for our own filthineſſe, as to bleſſe God for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>2. As ſin doth ſtill remain in perſons juſtified, <hi>ſo God doth ſee that remaining</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God ſees that remaining ſin.</note> 
                        <hi>ſin</hi> in them; he that made the eye, ſhall not he ſee? all things are naked and open before him; Gods ſeeing is diverſly taken in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Sometimes <hi>for his approving:</hi> Gen. 1. 31. <hi>And God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> Jonah. 3. 10. <hi>And God ſaw their works that they turnd from their evil way:</hi> He ſaw this with an eye of approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now in this ſenſe God doth not ſee ſin in any man, neither good nor bad, neither juſtified nor unjuſtified; for he is of <hi>purer eyes than to behold evil,</hi> Hab. 1. 13. and cannot look upon iniquity <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with approbation or liking.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For <hi>his wrathful obſerving and intention to condemn and deſtroy:</hi> Jer. 7. 11. <hi>Is this houſe which is called by my Name, become a Den of Robbers in your eyes! behold, even I have ſeen it, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>But go now unto my place which was in</hi> Shiloh, <hi>where I ſet my Name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſſe of my people Iſrael.</hi> Hoſ. 6. 10. <hi>I have ſeen an horrible thing in the houſe of Iſrael, there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Iſrael is defiled, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 6. <hi>God ſaw the wickedneſſe of man that it was great upon the earth.</hi> If you underſtand Gods ſeeing of ſin for ſuch an apprehenſion of ſin, as for it in wrath to judge and condemn, and eternally to deſtroy the ſinner, in this ſence God doth not ſee ſin in any that he pardons or juſtifies.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Sometimes for his <hi>knowing and taking notice of a thing,</hi> and <hi>that with diſlike;</hi> although not ſo far as finally to condemn: Now in this ſenſe God doth ſee the ſins of juſtified perſons: <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15. 3. Job. 10. 14. <hi>If I ſin, thou markeſt me.</hi>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:55323:195"/>
Pſal. 90. 8. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy Countenance.</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. <hi>Against thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight.</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 9. <hi>Why haſt thou</hi> (ſaid <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Commandement of the Lord, to do this evil in his ſight?</hi> This was that which did ſo aggravate <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, and ſo much break <hi>Davids</hi> heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But theſe are places for Believers in the Old Teſtament, whereas they who deny Gods ſeeing of ſin, mean it of Believers under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The Believers under the Old Teſtament were juſtified by Chriſt; their ſins were laid upon Chriſt, and taken away by Chriſt as well as believers under the New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>2. Why do they bring moſt of their proofs for this Opinion out of the Old Teſtament? As, <hi>God ſeeth no iniquity in Jacob;</hi> And, <hi>thou art all fair my love;</hi> and <hi>they ſhall be as white as ſnow;</hi> and <hi>blotted out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. But ſee for the New Teſtament, Luke 15. 21. where you have the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a penitent child; <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee,</hi> or in thy ſight. Rev. 2. 4. <hi>I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As God ſees the ſins in juſtified perſons, ſo likewiſe <hi>is he offended</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their ſins.</note> 
                        <hi>with thoſe ſinnes:</hi> But of this I ſhall ſpeak more fully in anſwer to the next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods covering or hiding of ſin in Juſtification, is not Excluſive of, or inconſiſtent with Gods ſeeing of ſin in his people,</hi> being rightly underſtood; for <note place="margin">Gods covering of ſin is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of his ſeeing of ſin.</note> there is a two-fold covering of ſin.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>From condemnation;</hi> Thus when God forgives ſins, he covers ſins ſo that they ſhall never appear and riſe up to condemn the perſon.</p>
                     <p>2. From <hi>apprehenſion and diſlike:</hi> Thus though the perſon be forgiven and juſtified, yet if he full into ſin, God ſees it and diſlikes it, yea hates it, though for Chriſts ſake be doth forgive the Perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But how can this be, that God ſhould ſee any ſin in believers, who have the Righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt which is perfect and without all ſinne!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt were inherently and ſubjectively in us, as it is in Chriſt; then indeed no ſin were to be ſeen in us: But that Righteouſneſs is ours only Relatively and not formally, it is imputed only to us, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that imputation there is ſin in us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is one thing to be conſidered in our ſelves, and another as cloathed with Chriſts Righteouſneſſe: In the former reſpect our ſins appear, and in the latter reſpect they are covered.</p>

                        <note place="margin">How Gods diſpleaſure and anger againſt his people is conſiſtent with his diſcharging of their ſins,</note>

How can it be affirmed that by forgiveneſſe of ſins, any perſon is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and freed, ſo that God remains no more offended, and diſpleaſed, and will not proceed againſt him, ſeeing that we read of his diſpleaſure, and anger, and proceedings againſt his people for ſinning againſt him?</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>God is displeaſed with the ſins of his own people:</hi> See this in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. <note place="margin">God is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſins of his own people.</note> 11. 27. <hi>But, the thing that David had done diſpleaſed the Lord.</hi> In <hi>Solomon,</hi>

1 King 11. 9. <hi>The Lord was angry with Solomon,</hi> becauſe <hi>his heart was turned away from the Lord God of Iſrael, who had appeared unto him twice.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he ſhould not go after other gods, but he kept not that which the Lord commanded.</hi> In <hi>Jehoſhapbat,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 2. <hi>Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>His anger hath broken out very ſharply upon them becauſe of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Nothing that we do</hi> (no mourning for ſin, no repenting for ſin) <hi>doth, or can untie the bond of ſin,</hi> releaſe, and acquit, and diſcharge, or abſolve from guilt: Although God doth not diſcharge us from repenting, yet our repenting doth not diſcharge us from our guilt and condemnation; that is the work of Gods grace in Chriſt, if any preſſe repentance upon that ground, as if forgiveneſs of ſin were the natural effect of repentance, that had a merit to deliver us from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he erres exceedingly, becauſe</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is an act only of God,</hi> repealing the ſentence of condemnation againſt us; it is only the Creditors act to diſcharge the debt.</p>
                     <p>2. There <hi>is not any ſufficient cauſality in our work of repentance,</hi> for ſuch an effect as forgiveneſs of ſin, For</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Our repentance is imperfect,</hi> and ſtands in need of the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num meum neque pure bonum eſt, neque meum eſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Suppoſe it were perfect, yet that could not take away the guilt of ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:55323:196"/>
becauſe ſin is an infinite offence and diſhonour to God; and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance can never bear that proportion in ſatisfying, which ſin hath in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It muſt be clearly acknowledged, that to ſet up repentance as a cauſe meriting forgiveneſſe of ſins, cannot conſiſt with Gods free forgiveneſſe of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Although forgiveneſſe of ſin be not the effect of mans repentance, <note place="margin">Yet repentance is required to the obtaining of forgiveneſs.</note> (for then we ſhould forgive our ſelves.) <hi>Yet repentance is required to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of forgiveneſſe:</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, &amp;c. and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Ezek. 18. 21. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 22. <hi>all his tranſgreſſions which he hath committed ſhall not be mentioned unto him.</hi> Luke 24. 47. <hi>That repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be purchaſed in his Name.</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>As to undertake any ſelf-ſatisfaction to God for their ſins;</hi> you read of their confeſſions and tears, and prayers, but not of their ſatisfaction; <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags.</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. <hi>Wherewithall ſhall I come before the Lord? ſhall I come before him with burnt-offerings? will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or with ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyle? &amp;c.</hi> Mich. 6. 6, 7. <hi>If I justifie my ſelf, mine own mouth will condemn me; if I ſay I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe,</hi> Job 9. 20.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>As to diſanull their relation to God of Sonſhip, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 64. 8. <hi>But now O Lord thou art our Father!</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord, neither remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber iniquity for ever: behold, ſee we beſeech thee, we are all thy people!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus opened and cleared the nature of the forgiveneſs of ſins, I proceed to the other part of the deſcription of it.</p>

                     <p>THE ſecond thing in the Propoſition of forgiveneſſe of ſins is this, <hi>viz. That God himſelf undertakes this work,</hi> and he undertakes it by promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>God undertakes to forgive ſins.</hi> Luk. 5. 21. <hi>Who can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake.</hi> Exo. 34. 6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>Keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and ſin.</hi> Dan. 9. 9. <hi>To thee, O Lord God, belongeth mercy, and forgiveneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Forgiveneſs of ſin is indeed one of his Royal Prerogatives; therefore you find his people making their addreſſes unto him for forgiveneſs of their ſins: Exod. 32. 32. <hi>Oh this people have ſinned a great ſin; yet now if thou wilt forgive their ſin, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 25. 18. <hi>Forgive all my ſins.</hi> Dan. 9. 19. <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive.</hi> Hoſe. 14. 2. <hi>Take away all iniquity.</hi> Act. 8. 22. <hi>Pray God if perhaps the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> There is a forgiveneſs</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>way of charity,</hi> wherein we forgive the offence and treſpaſs againſt us: If <hi>thy brother repent, forgive him,</hi> Luke 17. 3. <hi>And forgive one another, as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>way of Miniſtry;</hi> thus the Apoſtles, as Chriſt delivers it in Joh. 20. 23. <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. By way of <hi>immediate and abſolute authority;</hi> thus it belongs to God, and to him alone; God in Scripture is ſtiled <hi>a Judge: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> Gen. 18. 25. And to <hi>the Supreme Judge</hi> it belongs to condemn or to acquit. <hi>A Creditor;</hi> there was a <hi>certain Creditor which had two debtors,</hi> Luk. 7. 41. who can forgive the debt but the Creditor? A <hi>Lawgiver: There is one Lawgiver who is able to ſave and to deſtroy,</hi> Jam. 4 12. who can forgive the tranſgreſſions of the Law but the Lawgiver? Now God himſelf undertakes to forgive ſins, and none but he muſt do ſo. <note place="margin">Reaſons of it. God himſelf undertakes this work.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>all ſins are offences against him,</hi> and deviations from his righteous will, and injuries to his glory; even thoſe ſins which are wrongs unto men, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries alſo unto God; for his Will is ſlighted, and his Law is violated in them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the remiſſion of them is proper to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:55323:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, Becauſe unto whom the <hi>power of death and condemnation authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs,</hi> unto him alſo the power of life and abſolution doth belong; but the power of condemnation belongs only to God. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Theſe are acts ſeated in the ſame power.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſin takes off the infinite deſert of ſin,</hi> reaching even unto eternity of puniſhment (eternal puniſhment is deſerved by ſin) and who can relieve us from that but God alone?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Becauſe <hi>our conſciences might have a reſting place;</hi> which they could never have, if God himſelf did not forgive ſins. What if all the men in the world did forgive you, if God did not clear you, but ſtill held you guilty! What though all the lower Courts abſolve a Malefactor, as long as the Supreme Court condemns him! what though the Malefactor forgive himſelf, if the Judge do not forgive him? <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> But here lies the comfort, that God himſelf who is the Supreme Judge, who hath the Soveraign Power to ſave or to deſtroy, to remit or binde, to acquit or to condemn, whoſe ſentence none can reverſe; if he will pardon our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſinnes againſt him; now there is peace with him, and peace in our own Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As forgiveneſs of ſins ſolely appertains to God, ſo <hi>God undertakes the ſame by way of promiſe,</hi> which ſhews that he is willing to forgive ſins, and <note place="margin">God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it by promiſe.</note> that he engageth himſelf to forgive ſins, and that he will certainly forgive ſins. Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their ſin no more.</hi> Pro. 28. 13. <hi>Whoſoever confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall finde mercy.</hi> 2 Chro. 7. 14. <hi>If my people ſhall turn from their wicked wayes, then will I forgive their ſins.</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and turn unto the Lord, and he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon him, and abundantly pardon.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins; he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Now if any ſhould demand why God contents not himſelf with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> only that he is a God who forgives ſin; but alſo he makes a promiſe that he will forgive ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſuppoſe theſe Reaſons may be given of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. Becauſe <hi>this is a greater relief to the troubled conſcience:</hi> A promiſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe is a more hopeful foundation to work upon, than a meer Declaration that God hath power to forgive, and it ſerves to anſwer our fears and doubts more fully. You would not imagine how powerful and dreadful the guilt of ſin is, and how ſtrongly working when a conſcience is awakened, and wounded with the ſence of it! How great is the apprehenſion of Gods wrath! how amazing is the curſe threatned! how hard is it to look toward the Mercy ſeat through all the threatnings, and through all the terrors! how difficult is it to ſettle it with any apprehenſions of mercy! And therefore the Lord is pleaſed, not only to declare that he is a God forgiving ſins, but alſo he makes promiſe that he will forgive ſins for Chriſts ſake; this is apt to preſerve troubled ſinners from deſpair, and to breed ſome hopes in them, that perhaps they may find mercy; for who can tell but that a merciful God, and a God who promiſeth mercy to poor ſinners, may at length ſhew mercy to them, and forgive their ſins!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>this is a ſtronger Obligation and Argument to prevail with ſinners to repent of their ſins, and to turn unto the Lord.</hi> Beloved, I beſeech you mark what I ſay:</p>
                     <p>1. The greater inevidence and improbability there is of forgiveneſs of ſins, the more indiſpoſition and averſeneſs there is unto repentance: If a perſon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends mercy as impoſſible, he then looks upon repentance as unuſeful; either he grows deſpairing, or deſperate; For ſaith he, to what end ſhould I repent, and come into God who (I am ſure) will ſhew me no mercy?</p>
                     <p>2. Again, the greater hopes that a ſenſible ſinner hath of mercy, the more eaſily and kindly is his heart wrought upon to Repent, to come off
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55323:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from his ſins to God. <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 14. 2. When <hi>taking away of ſin</hi> is hinted, then <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, neither will we ſay to the works of our hands Ye are our gods; for in thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy;</hi> ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Return ye back-ſliding children, and I will heal your back-ſlidings; behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> Mark, how this inſinuation of mercy bowed in their hearts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now when a ſinner ſees forgiveneſs of ſins in a promiſe, this appears with more evidence of hope for him; I may yet have mercy, ſo great is Gods goodneſs, and why ſhould I ſtand out any longer? and why ſhould I for lying vanities forſake my own mercies? I will home to my Fathers houſe, for there is bread enough, and to ſpare, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe <hi>this is the ſureſt ground for faith;</hi> you know this is the great ſcruple, But may I find mercy? and what ground have I to expect mercy? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I do repent, what aſſurance have I that God will forgive my ſits? Why, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gods promiſe for the forgiveneſs of your ſins, in this caſe you may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that if you come to him, and rely upon him, he will unqueſtionably be as good as his word, he will ſhew mercy to you. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im bemoaning himſelf.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ezek. 18. 21. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, &amp;c. he ſhall ſurely live, and not dye.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>All his tranſgreſsions which he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him.</hi>

                        </label> Of the people of God ſome are ſooner in Covenant, and ſome are later in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for ſome are called at one houre, and ſome at another houre; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia,</hi> Rom. 16. 7. <hi>who were in Chriſt before me;</hi> that may we ſay of people, ſome are in Covenant before others; but as ſoon as any of them are brought into Covenant, they are pardoned immediatly, their ſins are forgiven unto them.</p>
                     <p>Again, of the people of God ſome have been greater ſinners, and ſome have been leſſer ſinners; but as ſoon as they have been made the people of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, their ſins have been forgiven; <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had her ſins forgiven, and <hi>Paul</hi> had his ſins forgiven, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Again, of the people of God ſome are weaker, and ſome are ſtronger, and both of them have their ſins forgiven. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 12. <hi>I write unto you little children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your ſins are forgiven you for his Names ſake.</hi>

Firſt, <hi>All who are in Chriſt, have their ſins forgiven them; but all the people who are in Covenant with God are in Chriſt;</hi> (my reaſon for that is this, becauſe only in and by Chriſt God becomes our God, there our relation riſeth) <hi>Ergo.</hi> For the firſt Propoſition, that is a clear truth; <hi>viz.</hi> That all who are in Chriſt have their ſins forgiven them; for Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for many, for remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Matth. 26. 28. <hi>and</hi> Matth. 1. 21. <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>And he hath delivered us from wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 10. <hi>And that we joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5. 11.</p>
                     <p>Now mark, if Chriſt ſaves his people from their ſins, and if he ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of their ſins; if by Chriſt they are freed from condemnation, and from wrath, and God is reconciled unto them, and through him they have good reaſon to joy in God, then unqueſtionably all who are in Chriſt have their ſins forgiven them; (for elſe how could they joy in God? &amp;c.) this is one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to demonſtrate that God forgives all his people in Covenant</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>All penitent and believing perſons have the forgiveneſs of ſins;</hi> but all the people whom God brings into Covenant with himſelf, are penitent and believing perſons: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The firſt of theſe Propoſitions is ſo clear and open in many places of Scripture, that it is needleſs to quote any pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce; you may at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure peruſe all thoſe promiſes of forgiveneſs unto repenting and believing perſons mentioned before. And the ſecond Propoſition is as clear; for repentance and faith are Covenant gifts, and given unto ſuch whom God owns for his people, and to none but ſuch; for God owns none for his people (in a Covenant way) who are impenitent and unbelieving.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>There are no enemies in the Covenant of Grace;</hi> none who hate God, and none whom God hates; none who ſet themſelves againſt him, and none againſt whom he ſets himſelf; but the Covenant of Grace is a Covenant of life, and of love, and of peace, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 61. All in this Covenant love God, and God loves them; they delight in God, and God delights in them; they walk with God, and God is ſaid to dwell in them, and to walk in them, they have peace with God, and God is at peace with them; he is their Father, and they are his ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; if this be ſo, (and ſo it is, if we do believe the Scriptures which ſay ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly) then aſſuredly all who are in Covenant, have their ſins pardoned; for ſuch mutual love, and ſuch mutual delight, and ſuch mutual dwelling, and ſuch mutual peace, and ſuch mutual relation, there cannot poſſibly be, unleſs ſins were forgiven, and all enmity ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is no damnation that ever was yet to be found in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace;</hi> ſalvation you find there, but damnation was never read of there: <hi>He that believes ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 15, 16. there is damnation for refuſing, not for entring; ſinners, who before they were in Covenant, were obnoxious to damnation for their ſins; are now delivered from it, by coming into the Covenant; never was, or ſhall any perſon be damned who is in Covenant, and hath God for his God; for they are <hi>bleſſed who have the Lord to be their God:</hi> But if their ſins were not forgiven, they were not <hi>bleſſed; for bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven,</hi> Rom 4 7. Neither ſhould they be ſaved, but muſt periſh for ever, and dye in their ſins.</p>
                     <p>And thus you ſee this part of the Propoſition of forgiveneſs of ſins cleared alſo; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is promiſed to all the people of God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

                     <p>4. NOW follows the fourth and the laſt part of the Propoſition, namely, <note place="margin">It is firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſed by God unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> That <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins is one of the mercies firſt promiſed by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people;</hi> as here in this place, it hath the heart-guard of the Covenant gifts, it takes the right hand, and the firſt place of the ſpiritual mercies promiſed. In this Scripture there is mention of three ſpiritual gifts, which are like <hi>Davids</hi> three Worthies; but this of Juſtification (this of remiſſion of ſins) is the firſt of them. Beloved, you muſt diſtinguiſh between the Covenant it ſelf, and the gifts thereof; the Covenant it ſelf lies in this; I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people; this cloſure, and this relation makes the Covenant; and when we are thus cloſed with God in Covenant, then come out the gifts of the Covenant which God deals and gives forth unto his people, and amongſt theſe, firſt we have a promiſe mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to forgive ſins.</p>
                     <p>Some may think the reaſon of this priority to be this, becauſe Juſtification goes before Sanctification. I confeſs that theſe are diſtinct works; but yet I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a priority of time between them, ſo that a perſon is firſt juſtified, and after that he is ſanctified: For (under favour) it cannot well be made out that there falls any ſpace or pauſe of time between thoſe; and my reaſon is this, becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When a man is once in Chriſt, Chriſt is at the ſame time made of God unto him Sanctification as well as righteouſneſs; therefore the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It cannot well be admitted that there ſhould be a true union with Chriſt conſiſting with a partial communion in benefits abſolutely neceſſary to conſtitute a Chriſtian; and ſuch a one is Sanctification.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is ſuch an immediate influence of life and grace upon believing, as raiſeth a conſimilitude and conformity.</p>
                     <p>But to omit all needleſs diſputes, I humbly conceive that there may be three reaſons why forgiveneſs of ſins is one of the firſt mercies mentioned in the promiſe. <note place="margin">Three reaſons of it. It doth moſt of all ſet forth the glory of God.</note>
                     </p>

Hence is it that his grace and mercy is ſo often called his glory. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 6 <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory;</hi> (i. e.) of his grace and mercy; ſee <hi>Rom</hi> 9. 23. <hi>That he might make known the riches of his glory on the Veſſels of mercy;</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord;</hi> (i. e.) the glory of his mercy, and love in Chriſt Jeſus; therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Who is a (ſtrong) God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage!</hi> as if Gods forgiving of ſins were one of the greateſt demonſtrations of his Deity. Though his Godhead doth appear in other of his Attributes, and in other of his Works, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 20.) yet it doth moſt clearly, and moſt comfortably appear in this merciful Attribute, and work of forgiveneſs of ſins; his wiſdom and his juſtice, and his power have put forth themſelves (as it were) in a way of ſubſerviency to the glory of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; he found out by his wiſdom a way to ſatisfie his juſtice by Chriſt, that ſo he
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55323:199"/>
might bring glory to his mercy in the forgiveneſs of our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>it is a mercy tranſcendently excellent,</hi> a mercy which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels <note place="margin">It is a mercy tranſcendently excellent. It excels the mercies of men.</note> moſt of the mercies which we do receive; there are,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The mercies of men;</hi> they do ſometimes pardon offences committed againſt them; but Gods forgiving mercies far exceed this; <hi>e. g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt. When man hath forgiven you, yet God may call you to an account, and queſtion, and condemn you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Mans forgiveneſs may acquit you from ſome temporal puniſhment due unto you by ſome humane Lawes by you tranſgreſſed; but Gods forgiveneſs reacheth to the diſcharge of you not only from temporal but alſo from eternal puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The mercy of man in forgiveneſs looks only at outward offences, but it meddles not with inward ſinnings (with thoſe of the heart) but Gods forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving extends to internal, inviſible obliquities, as well as external and inviſible tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When men forgive us, this perhaps may be ſome leſſer offences, but no great and capital; or if theſe, then the benefit of this forgiveneſs is loſt and forfeited by the next offence, as in the caſe of <hi>Shimei;</hi> but when God forgives a ſinner, he forgives all ſorts of ſinnings, and will never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe ſins again any more.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The mercies of God,</hi> whereof ſome are corporal, and ſome are ſpiritual; now forgiveneſs of ſins doth excell.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>All the corporal mercies or bleſsings</hi> which poſſibly can be enjoyed in <note place="margin">It excels cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies.</note> this world; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One may enjoy all corporal bleſſings in greater abundance, and this may be all his portion; <hi>(they have their portion in this life,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 17. 14.) but forgiveneſs of ſins is a mercy which never goes alone, but hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy of all choice bleſſings; it is a better portion, and yet not all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The outward bleſſings reſpect only the condition of the body, the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, delight, eaſe, relief, ſupport and ſafety of that; and notwithſtanding this preheminence, the ſoul may be in a moſt miſerable condition; but forgiveneſs of ſins hath a ſpecial reſpect to the ſoul, and the welfare and everlaſting good of it, and happineſs of it; it makes us truly bleſſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding the preſence of outward bleſſings, the ſpiritual miſery of man is nothing altered, they cannot releaſe you from the wrath of God, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you from that curſe which the Law pronounces againſt you for your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; but when God forgives ſins, then the forgiven perſon is freed from wrath and curſe, and condemnation, and God is pacified and reconciled.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. One may poſſibly enjoy them, and yet never enjoy God, nor Chriſt, nor peace in conſcience, nor glory in heaven; nay, his enjoyment of theſe may (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally) cauſe a farther diſtance from God and Chriſt; (as in the <hi>young man</hi> whoſe riches and poſſeſſions kept him off from cloſing with Chriſt) but forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins neceſſarily involves all theſe grand enjoyments; if ſins be forgiven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably God is your God, and Chriſt is your Redeemer, and heaven is your inheritance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>It excells, if not all yet certainly moſt of Gods ſpiritual mercies:</hi> I <note place="margin">It excels moſt of Gods ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mercies.</note> am unwilling to make compariſons between them; yet with reverence I ſpeak it, that forgiveneſs of ſins in ſome reſpects excells all the graces in man.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>For the perfection of the work:</hi> the change of the ſoul by grace is indeed an <note place="margin">For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the work.</note> excellent work; nevertheleſs it is imperfect; (therefore it gets on by degrees) but the forgiveneſs of ſin is a perfect work: when God ſanctifies a man, he doth it ſo that the perſon needs yet more holineſs; but when he forgives us, he doth it not ſo that thoſe ſins need more of forgiveneſs; when he ſanctifies a man, there
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:55323:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtill remains ſome corruption; but when he forgives a ſinner, you cannot ſay there remains yet ſomething behind of condemnation; God can find enough in our graces to except againſt, but nothing in his forgiveneſs of ſins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>For the cauſality in the work;</hi> Compare your graces, and your forgiveneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">For the cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the work.</note> together; there are ſeveral choice effects in the ſoul, which you cannot affirme of your graces as their cauſe; yet you may ſafely affirm Gods forgiveneſs of ſins to be their cauſe; <hi>e. g. peace in conſcience;</hi> you cannot ſay that any holineſs or righteouſneſs in you is the cauſe of this; (for conſcience cannot be quieted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in us) but forgiveneſs of ſin is a juſt cauſe of peace in conſcience; <hi>being justified by faith, we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. I will ſay no more at preſent, but that all the ſprings of joy and peace, and comfort, are in your juſtification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> Matth. 9. 2.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe it is a mercy which doth exceedingly concern afflicted and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is a mercy doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern afflicted conſciences.</note> 
                        <hi>diſtreſſed ſouls:</hi> Beloved, remember three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All the men in the world do need forgiveneſs of ſins; for who is he that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and ſinneth not? and what ſinner is there who needs not to have his ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All the people of God do ſee the need and worth of it; how earneſt have they been to attain to it? <hi>David</hi> in Pſal. 51. prays ten times for it, ſo the <hi>Church, Remember not iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 64. 9. <hi>Take away iniquity,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Afflicted and diſtreſſed ſouls, they infinitely prize it, and thirſt for it, and their ſoul will ſink and fail without it. Take me any ſoul whatſoever, as ſoon as ever it comes to be a wounded and diſtreſſed ſoul, preſently it cries out, what ſhall I do? what will become of me without Chriſt, and without forgiveneſs of ſins? if God forgives not theſe ſins, I am a loſt man! O that I might have mercy! when ſhall I find mercy! May I look for mercy? is there any hope of mercy? I tell you Sirs, the wounded ſinner apprehends wrath and condemnation, and feels ſin with ſuch a weight and terror in conſcience, that if ſome hope of mercy did not preſently appear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 16. <hi>the ſpirit would fail before him;</hi> it would be conſumed with deſpair; therefore no marvail that God is pleaſed in the firſt place to hold out this golden Scepter of forgiveneſs of ſins, whereby to relieve all broken-hearted ſinners.</p>

                     <p>For the managing of this Uſe, I will lay down theſe three concluſions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Some there are who do refuſe God to be their God in Covenant, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be a people in Covenant with him.</item>
                        <item>2. All theſe are an unforgiven people; their ſins neither are forgiven, nor ſhall they ever be forgiven unto them.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe their ſins are unforgiven, therefore they are in a moſt miſerable and dreadful condition.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>There are ſome who do refuſe God to be their God in Covenant, and do refuſe</hi>

But more particularly there are four ſorts of men who refuſe God to be their God in Covenant, and to be his people.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Such as refuſe the authority of God to rule and guide them by his Will and Laws:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Such as refuſe to be guided by his Laws.</note> When God is a God in Covenant, there he is acknowledged as Lord and Law-giver; <hi>(the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King,</hi> Iſa. 33. 22.) nay, he will be ſo acknowledged or elſe he will not be a God in Covenant with us; ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 14. <hi>If ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all theſe Commandments;</hi> and ver. 15. <hi>If ye ſhall dispute my Statutes, and if your ſoul abhor my judgments;</hi> then ver. 17. <hi>I will ſet my face againſt you, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 81. 11. <hi>But my people would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> If any man hath a nature which is at enmity with God, and will not be ſubject unto his Will and Law, how can there be a Covenant between them and God? for in forming up of a Covenant, there muſt be an agreement between the parties; but if we ſet up our wills againſt Gods will, that we will do, not what comes from his mouth, but what comes from our own hearts; not what he commands, but what our own proud luſts do like; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly God neither is, nor will be in Covenant with ſuch a people; for hereby he ſhould loſe the glory of being a Lord, and we ſhould not ſubmit to his righteous will, but he ſhould ſubject himſelf unto our ungodly luſts.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Such as maintain a contrariety and incompliance with the glorious nature of God:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Such as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the glorious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God.</note> This is the glory of the Divine nature, that it is holy; <hi>(Holy, holy, holy Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> Rev. 4. 8.) and this is that about which God inſiſts with all perſons, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) whom he will own for his people in Covenant, <hi>Ye ſhall be holy, for I am holy,</hi> Lev. 11. 44. For there muſt be a ſimilitude 'twixt God, and the people of God; and as he declares his choice love to them, ſo muſt they be a choice generation, and an holy Nation to ſhew forth his praiſes; therefore ſuch perſons as are not only unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a <hi>privative way,</hi> but alſo hate holineſs, and cannot endure to be made holy in a <hi>poſitive</hi> adherency of holineſs, God neither is, nor ever will be a God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, nor can they be a people in Covenant with God; for <hi>what commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can there be 'twixt light and darkneſs?</hi> and what Covenant can there be made 'twixt the holy God who hates all unholineſs, and ungodly perſons who do likewiſe hate and abhor all holineſs?</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Such as refuſe to let go their ſins,</hi> and will hold faſt their iniquities, who will ſpare <note place="margin">Such as refuſe to let go their ſins.</note> them, and not forſake them, as <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 30. <hi>who refuſe to return,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 5. God is no God in Covenant with theſe, neither are they, nor can they be a people in Covenant with him. <hi>Pſal</hi> 50. 16. <hi>Unto the wicked God ſaith, What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my word behind thee.</hi> Joſh. 24. 23. <hi>Now therefore put away the ſtrange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>So Joſhua made a Covenant with the people that day.</hi> If a mans heart be ſet on his ſins, I will love them, I will ſerve them, I will not forſake them, it cannot be that there ſhould be a Covenant made up 'twixt God and him. <note place="margin">Such as through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief perſevere in refuſing Chriſt.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Such as through unbelief perſevere in the refuſing of Chriſt;</hi> you think it no great matter to have Jeſus Chriſt preach'd unto you, and offered unto you, and yet for you to ſlight Jeſus Chriſt thus offered; but remember what I ſay, that perſon who refuſeth Chriſt, doth refuſe God to be his God in Covenant; <hi>He that refuſeth you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth me; and he that refuſeth me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luk. 10. 16. God becomes our God, and our Father only in Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I go to my God, and to your God; and my Father, and your Father,</hi> Joh: 2. 17.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond concluſion is this, that <hi>all uncovenanted people are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgiven people;</hi> (i. e.) all who do continue to refuſe God to be their God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55323:201"/>
and to be his people in Covenant, their ſins neither are forgiven, nor ever ſhall be forgiven; why ſo will you ſay? becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſins is only promiſed in the Covenant of Grace,</hi> in no Covenant but <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> this; not in the Covenant of Works, for that is a letter of death and condemnation unto the ſinner.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as it is only in the Covenant of Grace, ſo <hi>it is promiſed only to the people in that Covenant.</hi> 1 Kin. 8. 34. <hi>Forgive the ſin of thy people.</hi> Ver. 36. <hi>Forgive the ſin of thy ſervants.</hi> Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Only thoſe who are in Chriſt ſhall have their ſins forgiven.</hi> Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Acts 10. 43. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Joh. 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi> Joh. 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>All impenitent perſons are unforgiven perſons; all uncovenanted perſons are impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly Now follows the third concluſion, <hi>Becauſe theſe ſins are unforgiven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, The unforgiven ſinner is under <hi>the greateſt loſs and privation</hi> which man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly <note place="margin">He is under the greateſt loſſe and privation.</note> can be; and what is that greateſt loſs and privation? if you know what the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good and happineſs is, you may then quickly tell what the greateſt loſs and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is; to enjoy God perfectly and fully and eternally in glory, is there any good and happineſs like unto this! O but the unforgiven ſinner ſhall never ſee God in glory, he ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord; heaven is no place for the enemies of God; ſins unpardoned, are like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel with a flaming Sword, who kept the paſſage into Paradiſe; there is no entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life with ſins unpardoned; they do certainly and eternally bar up that door of heaven, and heavenly happineſs; and now how miſerable muſt that ſoul be which is eternally excluded from all true happineſs?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Law of God is in full power againſt every unpardoned ſinner.</hi> 1.

                     <p>Thirdly, The unforgiven ſinner <hi>walks all his dayes under the wrath of God:</hi>

                        <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> Pſal. 7. 11. not with <hi>a Paternal,</hi> but with <hi>a Judicial</hi> anger, even to hatred and abhorment: The <hi>wicked is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto him, and he hates all workers of iniquity,</hi> Prov. 3. 32. 15. 9. And this wrath God can reveal it to his ſoul, and poure it forth upon him when he pleaſeth: and when God poures on him the fierceneſs of his wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he can neither decline it nor ſuſtain it: it is like the tempeſt and whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds; it is like burning fire, and devouring flames; it drives the ſinner to his feet, breakes down all his arrogancies, and vain hopes, and ſenſual joyes, and fills him with amazing diſtractions, and terrors, and deſpairs. How heavy was this wrath on <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffering for our ſins? it made him to ſweat clods of blood; how terrible is the apprehenſion and fear of it to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Heman?</hi> how infinitely dreadful will the ſenſe of it be to the unforgiven ſinner who hath no part in Chriſt, no hope nor plea by him?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>unforgiven ſinner is obnoxious to the ſevere Authority of an</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He is obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to an awaking guilty conſcience.</note> 
                        <hi>awakning guilty conſcience,</hi> and unto all the powerful workings of it: Indeed whiles the conſcience remains ſtupid and ſeared, although ſins be unforgiven, there is a quietneſſe in the ſoule (like a ſick man aſleep.) <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> But when God irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably awakes conſcience by effectual light, and gives it a charge to act its office of accuſing and condemning; O Lord, in what a caſe will the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſinner now be! now the man muſt ſee all his ſins, and now he muſt ſee them in all their offence, and provocations and deſerts; and now he muſt ſee them all as unforgiven, and himſelf therefore obnoxious to death, and wrath, and curſe, and hell; and conſcience ſets on all theſe with a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and with ſuch piercing woundings, and with ſuch continual terror and horror, that the unpardoned ſinner is at his wits end: <hi>A wounded Conſcience</hi> (or Spirit) <hi>who can bear!</hi> Prov. 18. 14. He is like <hi>Paſhor-Magor-Miſſabib, a terror round abount</hi> unto himſelf; the guilt of his unpardoned ſins works on his ſoul, and on his body; his ſoul hath them now before it, and the thoughts of his ſoul are perplexed and aſtoniſhed (what ſhall I do, and what will become of me!) And his afflictions are breaking with fears, and with deſpaires, his eyes are rolling, his feet and joynts ſhaking, and his body trembling: he knows not what to do with himſelf, nor how to fly from himſelf! Conſcience ſtill cries, and ſtill purſues, and ſtill wounds, and ſtill gnaws, and ſtill flames and burnt, and ſtill condemns him; thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, thou art loſt for ever, God is thy Judge, thy ſins are unforgiven, and thy portion is damnation; the poor wretch of times cries out, O Conſcience be quiet, ſpare me a little, give me a little ſpace, a minute, an hours reſt. I can allow thee no <hi>Interim,</hi> ſaith Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how can I! thy ſins are not forgiven, and God hath given me a charge againſt thee, and therefore how can I be quiet, or how can I ſpeak to him, unto whom God ſaith there is no peace but wrath! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 21.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The unforgiven ſinner <hi>muſt meet with death, and death muſt meet with</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He muſt meet with death as a king of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> 
                        <hi>him as a king of fears,</hi> and as armed againſt him with the guilt of his ſins; the <hi>ſting of death is ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 56. death is no great matter, but the ſting of death, that is terrible, that is like the ſting of a Serpent, or of the Scorpion, piercing, poyſoning, enraging, and killing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſeth that there were three things which he durſt not think of without Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Of his ſinnes.</hi> 2. <hi>Of death.</hi> 3. <hi>Of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> why what is death to an unpardoned ſinner? I will tell you what it is.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a full period to all comforts and delights;</hi> the unpardoned ſinner ſhall
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55323:202"/>
never taſte of delight more to all Eternity: when a juſtified perſon dyes, he ſhall never ſee any ſorrow more; and when an unpardoned ſinner dyes, he ſhall never ſee delight in any kind more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A full period to all Reprieves and Bayles;</hi> the ſinner during life may be Reprieved from many an Execution of wrath and judgement; but when he dies, there is no longer reprieving, he muſt now appear in perſon before the righteous God, anſwer for himſelf; and give up his account, and to receive according to what he hath done.</p>
                     <p>Now how dreadful will this be to the unpardoned ſinner, on whoſe ſoul and conſcience the guilt of all his ſins is engraven! O ſaith he, I cannot live, and I muſt die, I have not a day longer, nor an hour longer, and then muſt I appear before Gods Judgement ſeat; and what will become of one who never repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who never believed, who never had part in Chriſt, who never had his ſins forgiven to him?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the unpardoned ſinner <hi>must receive that just and irreverſible ſentence of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, there is a twofold ſentence which God will pronounce at the laſt day.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is of <hi>comfort and abſolution: Come ye bleſſed inherit the kingdom prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you,</hi> Matth 25. 34.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is of <hi>terror and condemnation: Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Divel and his Angels:</hi> and both theſe ſentences are already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified unto us in this life: <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. How dreadful this ſentence of condemnation will be, I pray God that none of us may find; but certainly all unpardoned ſinners ſhall find it; God will pronounce it againſt them! how can it be otherwiſe, if ſinners be not pardoned? if ſinners be not pardoned, then the ſinner is not abſolved; and if he be not abſolved, he muſt be condemned.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But God may forgive him in that day?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> No no, that day is not a day of forgiving, though it be a day of publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who hath been forgiven, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Upon this ſentence <hi>immediately follows execution:</hi> God condemns <note place="margin">And execution immediately follows, To all eternity</note> theſe ſins, and they ſhall be condemned; he adjudgeth them to hell to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Divel and his Angels, and thither they go to ſuffer that wrath which their ſins have deſerved.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, And this poenal endurance of wrath, <hi>it muſt continue to all eternity;</hi> As long as God is God, ſo long muſt the wrath of God abide on them: the worm never dies, and the fire of hell never goes out.</p>
                     <p>And if theſe things be ſo, then by the way learn four things.</p>

                     <p>Beloved, it is true, that God can and doth forgive ſins, and will do ſo; but yet he will do this in that way, and in that order which he hath preſcribed in his own Word; we may not ſay, Why, I am a ſinner, and therefore God will forgive me: (as if one ſhould ſay, I am a debtor, therefore the Creditor will releaſe me; and I am an offender, and therefore the Judge will abſolve me:) Nor may we

ſay abſolutely God is a merciful God, and therefore he will forgive me; for as God is a merciful God, and may therefore forgive; ſo he is a righteous God, and therefore he may condemn. Nor may we ſay that God promiſeth forgiveneſs of ſins, therefore our ſins are forgiven; for as God promiſeth mercy, he contracts that promiſe of mercy unto his own people: and as God ſaith he will mercifully pardon, ſo he ſaith likewiſe that he will not be merciful to any wicked tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59 5.

                     <p>But conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The graciouſneſs of God in forgiving of ſins, ſtands in oppoſition, not to the means which God hath preſcribed to enjoy forgiveneſs, but unto our merits and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of forgiveneſs;</hi> God forgives ſins freely and graciouſly, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merit or deſert of ours. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25. <hi>I even I, am be that blotteth out thy tranſgreſsions for mine name ſake;</hi> but God doth not forgive ſins freely, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> without our repenting and believing; for theſe he doth require of us, that we may receive the forgiveneſs of our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When God is ſaid to forgive ſins freely, the meaning is not that he forgives every ſinner in the world, (freeneſs notes the means, not the extent of forgiveneſs) with ſuch a free unlimited largeneſs he doth not forgive; but the meaning is, that all thoſe ſinners who are forgiven, they are freely forgiven; God doth not put them upon any perſonal ſatisfactions; nor doth he agree with them

for any work of theirs, as a cauſe or deſert of the forgiveneſs of their ſins. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord; and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon thee? for I am merciful,</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt did ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of ſins is moſt true, he himſelf hath delivered it: <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for the remiſsion of ſins;</hi> but that his blood did procure an actual remiſſion of ſins for every ſinner in the world, this is moſt falſe; for Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believes, ſhall be ſaved; and he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> Joh. 10. 15. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep.</hi> Joh. 8. 24. <hi>If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins;</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Mary, Mat.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for your help and direction in this point, take my mind in theſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>That there was a neceſsity for Chriſt to ſhed his blood,</hi> that ſo our ſins might be forgiven. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſsion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>His death did purchaſe the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. This remiſſion purchaſed, <hi>though illimited</hi> as to the ſins forgiven, yet it is <hi>limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> as to the perſons forgiven: 1. By the Decree of God to the Elect. 2. By the Covenant. 3. And by the intention of Chriſt. 4. And by the Goſpel to whoſoever believes that the ſhedding of his blood for the remiſſion of ſins, did ſo illimitedly procure the ſame. That every ſinner in the world enjoys the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (whether he believes or not, or whether he repents or not) as I know no man living of ſo wicked an opinion, ſo the Scripture delivers no ſuch matter, but the quite contrary. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>That repentance and remiſsion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations.</hi> Acts 10. 43. <hi>To him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſins.</hi> Acts 13. 38. <hi>Through this man is preached unto you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins.</hi> Ver. 39. <hi>Then Peter ſaid, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſsion of ſins.</hi> Rom. 3. 25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for the remiſsion of ſins that are paſt.</hi> It is true, that remiſſion of ſins hath foundation in the blood of Chriſt, as in a meritorious cauſe, but our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that merited and purchaſed remiſſion takes in faith and repentance; for neither God nor Chriſt ever intended nor promiſed the application thereof unto any, but ſuch as believe and repent; therefore do not venture abſolutely upon this, that Chriſt dyed for the remiſſion of ſins, therefore your ſins are forgiven; for as God did ordain the death of Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe of forgiveneſs of ſins; ſo did he ordain that all who have the benefit thereof, ſhould repent and believe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A fourth falſe ground from which ſome do (abſolutely) conclude that their ſins are forgiven, is this, <hi>their ſins are but ſmall and little ſins,</hi> which <note place="margin">The ſmalneſs of ſin.</note> God marks and regards not, and will never take notice of, but will paſs them by;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55323:204"/>
indeed if they were guilty of great tranſgreſſions, then they had reaſon to doubt whether they were within the compaſs of forgiveneſs promiſed, but alas their ſins are ſmall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <item>4. This very conceit that ſins are little, and are paſt by in courſe, may loſe a man the forgiveneſs of his ſins.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>No ſin is ſimply or abſolutely little or ſmall,</hi> though <hi>comparatively</hi> (when we ſet on ſin by another) we find them to be of different magnitude; ſome to be great abominations, and others to be leſſer tranſgreſſions, yet abſolutely no ſin is little; but as there is a greatneſs in the leaſt mercy, ſo there is a greatneſs in the leaſt ſin; for every ſin whatſoever is a tranſgreſſion of the royal Law, and it is committed againſt a great God; ſin is to be conſidered as to the object, as well as to the act; how were ye not afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant <hi>Moſes.</hi> Every ſin doth expoſe to a great curſe, even the curſe of the Law; <hi>Curſed is every one who continues not in every thing that is written to do it:</hi> Is that a ſmall offence which may coſt a man his life? nay, it cannot be taken off but by the death and blood of Chriſt, there is an infinite offence and merit in any ſin; you read in the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> that the <hi>blood of the beaſt</hi> was to be ſhed for the expiation of ſins of <hi>ignorance and inadvertency,</hi> which did ſignifie the ſhedding of the blood of Chriſt for the expiation of the leaſt ſins; and ſurely that offence may not be reputed little or ſmall, which cannot be put away but by the death of the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe ſins are not little or ſmall which people (ordinarily) do count ſo;</hi> people do look on it as a very ſmall offence.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is <hi>an oppoſition of the Gospel;</hi> the Goſpel muſt be preached, and the Goſpel muſt be oppoſed by ſuch as hear it, elſe it is not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; they therefore who are charged with this ſin, are ſaid <hi>to hate the light,</hi>

Joh. 3. 20. and to <hi>hate Chriſt,</hi> and to hate the truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 25. and to be <hi>diſobedient unto the Goſpel,</hi> and to be a <hi>gain-ſaying people,</hi> Rom. 10. 21. and to <hi>reject the Corner ſtone,</hi> Acts 4. 11. and to <hi>refuſe to hear,</hi> Acts 13. 46. and to <hi>put the Word from them,</hi> who <hi>reſiſt the truth,</hi> and <hi>contradict it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 8. as you may read of the Phariſees, and other of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a <hi>peculiar kind of oppoſition,</hi> not of ignorance, not of inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, not of paſſion; but</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A wilful oppoſition;</hi> therefore they who commit this ſin, are ſaid to <hi>ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;</hi> (Hebr. 10. 26. <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.)</hi> A man ſins wilfully, when the reaſon of his ſinning reſts ſolely in the perverſeneſs of his will, though his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be diſarmed of all Apology, and his conſcience be convinced, yet he will ſin and oppoſe the Goſpel, becauſe he will do ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A malicious oppoſition;</hi> it ariſeth from a bitter hatred againſt Chriſt, and rage againſt the truth; therefore they who ſin this ſin, are ſaid to <hi>offer,</hi> or <hi>do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite unto the Spirit of grace,</hi> Hebr. 10 29. as if they did ſin on purpoſe to vex and affront the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A reproachful oppoſition;</hi> hence it is affirmed of theſe ſinners, that they ſpeak evil of the ways of Chriſt, and blaſpheme his Word: The Jews <hi>were filled with envy, and ſpake againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken by Paul, contradicting and blaſpheming,</hi> Acts 13. 45. that they mock at Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 41. <hi>The chief Prieſts mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 29. <hi>When they had platted a Crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a Reed in his right hand, and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying, Hail King of the Jews;</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Others mocking, ſaid, theſe men are full of new wine.</hi> And they are ſaid (in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 29.) <hi>to tread under foot the Son of God, and to count his blood an unholy thing.</hi> How amazing is this reproach? and thus is it with all who ſin the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; the precious blood of Chriſt, his holineſs, his truth, his commands, his ways, his ſervants are the objects of their mockings, and ſcorns, and reproaches.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This oppoſition is made <hi>againſt Chriſt and the Goſpel, after and againſt the clear Convictions of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> They who ſinne this ſin,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Have had ſuch a light in them as to know Jeſus Christ,</hi> Joh. 9. 41.

                     <p n="2">2. The Holy Ghoſt hath not only illuminated their minds, but hath alſo <hi>raiſed them to a kind of approbation of Christ</hi> and his truths, and his ways; ſo that they have taken upon them the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and ſide with the Goſpel for a time.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>By the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, they have attained unto ſome ſpiritual taſte and experience,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Have taſted of the heavenly gift:</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>And have taſted of the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come.</hi>

The promiſe of forgiveneſs is to him who doth repent or forſake his ſins; it is not to him who defers to repent, and ſaith he will do ſo hereafter: O how fooliſh is the ſinner who might be preſently forgiven upon a preſent repentance, and yet will hazard his ſoul to the loſs of mercy upon a preſumption of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting!

                     <p>Fourthly, They do put themſelves out of a capacity of the forgiveneſs of their ſins, who do preſently repent, but it is fainedly and hypocritically, not cordially <note place="margin">They who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent preſently but fainedly.</note> and really: <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 10 <hi>Her treacherous ſister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but fainedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Pſal 78. v. 4. <hi>They returned and inquired early after God.</hi> Ver. 36. <hi>Nevertheleſſe they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongue.</hi> Ver. 37. <hi>For their heart was not right with him.</hi>

                     <p>Now they do repent fainedly, who 1. Spare their beloved ſins. 2. Who put them off with a purpoſe to reſume them again.</p>

                     <p>Here conſider a few Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is one thing <hi>to doubt and fear,</hi> and queſtion whether God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto our ſins; and it is another thing to <hi>deſpaire of his mercies:</hi> one may fear and doubt of mercy for his ſins, who yet doth not abſolutely deſpair of mercy; fear and queſtionings about mercy may ariſe from infirmity, Pſal. 77. 9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious! hath he in anger ſhut up his mercies!</hi> Ver 10. <hi>I ſaid this is my infirmity;</hi> but abſolute deſpair of mercy ariſeth from abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and it is a peremptory concluding againſt all the powers and goodneſs of mercy in God: <hi>My ſinne</hi> (ſaid <hi>Cain) is greater than may or can be forgiven,</hi> Gen. 4. 13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, there is <hi>a paſſionate</hi> and <hi>tranſient deſpaire;</hi> And there is a ſetled and <hi>permanent deſpaire;</hi> The one is total, but not final; the other is total and final; In times of ſtrong temptation, and Gods deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our own melancholy, and troubles of conſcience, one may poſſibly conclude there is no hope of mercy, and his ſins are ſuch as exceed either the power, or elſe the purpoſe of Gods mercy; but this dark and ſad conceit falls off again from the ſoul upon conference upon better information, upon prayer, upon hearing the Word, and upon clear conſideration of the Covenant of grace, and the terms of it, and of the riches of Redemption by Chriſt; this kind of deſpair doth not prejudice you in the capacity of forgiving mercy: but then there is a ſetled and permanent deſpair which is total and final, wherein the ſoul is ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and for ever lies under water and never riſeth more with any hope of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mercy, conceiving of the guilt of ſin ſo ſuperlatively, that neither the merits of the blood of Chriſt, nor the riches of mercy in God can or will reach to the forgiveneſs of it.

                     <p>Eighthly, Laſtly they do put themſelves out of a capacity of the forgiveneſs of their ſins, <hi>who are unmerciful, implacable, revengeful, and will not forgive others</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Thus you ſee that all truely penitent perſons are broken-hearted <note place="margin">Mourning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſin, are in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of pardon.</note> perſons, <hi>and mourning perſons for their ſins;</hi> and now ye ſhall find that <hi>all theſe perſons are within the capacity of the promiſe of forgiveneſſe of ſins:</hi> Zach. 12. 11. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo.</hi> Zach. 13. 1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountain opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin and for uncleanneſſe.</hi> Jer. 31. 18. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him.</hi> Mark the place, <hi>Ephraims</hi> heart is troubled for ſinning, and Gods bowels (ſo are his mercies ſtiled) are troubled for <hi>Ephraim; Ephraim</hi> (like a penitent Childe) falls a weeping, and God (like an indulgent Father) falls a bemoaning of him. I am grieved, and troubled, and aſhamed at my very heart that I have thus ſinned againſt thee, ſaith <hi>Ephraim.</hi> O peace, refrain thine eyes from tears, ſaith God to <hi>Ephraim;</hi> I cannot refrain my mercies from thee; Lo this is thy pardon for thy ſins: Pſal. 51. 17. <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit;</hi> and why is a broken ſpirit called ſacrifices of God? Is it not for the acceptableneſs of it unto God? and is it not becauſe as upon ſacrifices ſins were put away, ſo upon contrition of heart for ſins, there comes out the forgiveneſs of ſins?

                     <p>2.

                     </p>
                     <p>3. The third and laſt part of Repentance, <hi>is converſion, or turning from</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Converſion from ſin to God.</note>

                     <p>Two things you alſo read of this part of Repentance.</p>

                     </p>

                        <hi>under the promiſe of forgiveneſs, of ſin.</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth, and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall finde mercy.</hi> Many men confeſs their ſins, who yet do ſtill love to keep their ſins, and therefore ſhall miſs of mercy; but the way for mercy is, to forſake their ſin, as well as to confeſs ſin. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his way, and let the unrighteous forſake his thoughts, and let him return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus have I opened unto you the integral parts of Repentance, which doth certainly bring us within the capacity of the promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſhall now proceed to handle the <hi>Qualifications of every one of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The right qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of thoſe parts of Repentance.</note> 
                        <hi>theſe parts of Repentance,</hi> by which you may know that you do in truth act every one of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſequently are under the promiſe, &amp;c. And the rather do I inſiſt on this, becauſe many perſons do think that they are ſorry for their ſins, and do think that they do rightly confeſs their ſins, and do think that they forſake their ſins (and thereupon do preſume upon forgiving mercy) whereas really they are ſtill under the love and power, and ſervice of their ſins, and do not repent at all; all which you ſhall find (in every part which I have mentioned) clearly inſtanced in Scripture.</p>

Firſt, For <hi>mourning and weeping,</hi> and afflicting the ſoul; perſons have acted ſomething in this way, and yet have not repented in truth, and therefore have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of forgiveneſs. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>This have ye done again, covering the Altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and with crying, inſomuch that ye regarded not the offering any more.</hi> All this was but hypocriſie; for notwithſtanding all theſe tears, <hi>they dealt treacherouſly every one againſt his brother,</hi> Ver. 10. And <hi>profaned the holineſs of the Lord which he loved, and married the daughter of a ſtrange god,</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſouls, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt as I have choſen? a day for a man to afflict his ſoul? &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, For <hi>confeſsion of ſins,</hi> ſome have done this, and yet they have not rightly and penitentially done this. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>Pharaoh ſaid, I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked;</hi> ſee what a confeſſion is here! but then ſee, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>er.</hi> 34. <hi>when Pharaoh ſaw that the rain and the hail, and the thunder were ceaſed, he ſinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his ſervants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For <hi>turning from ſin,</hi> ſome have pretended thus far, and yet have not truly acted therein. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned, and enquired early after God.</hi> Ver. 35, 36. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongues.</hi> Ver. 37. <hi>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> Jer. 2. 20. <hi>Of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burſt thy hands, and thou ſaidſt I will not tranſgreſs; when upon every high hill, and under every green Tree thou wanderedſt, playing the harlot.</hi> Thus you ſee that ſome have pretended to all the parts of Repentance, and yet have not acted up to any one part in truth. Therefore I will now deliver unto you the right qualifications of all thoſe parts of Repentance, that ſo you may know whether you do truly repent of your ſins, and conſequently are under this moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſe of the forgiveneſs of your ſins.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The qualifications of penitential grief, or mourning for ſinnes,</hi> are <note place="margin">The qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin. It is a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural grief.</note> theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>grief which is ſupernatural,</hi> and wrought in us only by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; it doth not ariſe from the ſtrength of any natural principle in our own hearts, as worldly ſorrow doth; (in which one may abound who hath no grace at all, and for which he needs not to pray at all) but this ſorrow is given from God, and is ſought by us from him. <hi>Job</hi> 23. 16. <hi>God maketh my heart ſoft.</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> Zach. 12. 10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn, &amp;c.</hi> You may eaſily mourn for worldly loſſes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der worldly diſtreſſes, and melt, and weep, as <hi>Davids</hi> men did, who wept untill they had no more power to weep: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 4. And yet under all theſe floods of grief, the perſon may not be able to ſhed one tear of godly ſorrow for his ſins, becauſe this comes from another kind of Spring, and is raiſed upon other Motives and Conſiderations; it will coſt you many convictions, and many medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and many earneſt ſupplications, and attendances on the Word, to get this Fountain ſet open in your hearts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a grief which is <hi>ſincere for ſin as ſin;</hi> ſin as ſin is a tranſgreſſion <note place="margin">A ſincere grief for ſin as ſin.</note> of the Law of God, a provocation of God, a diſhonour unto God, a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and withdrawment of God, a defilement and pollution of the ſoul; and in a reſpect (ſolely) unto theſe conſiderations of ſin, doth truly penitential mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing break forth in the ſoul; though no hell to damn me, though no conſcience to torment me: <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou</hi>
                        <pb n="395" facs="tcp:55323:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>preſerver of men? Job</hi> 7. 20. One may be troubled for ſinning becauſe of puniſhment from man, or of puniſhment from God, feared or inflicted; but this is not a trouble for ſin as an offence to God, but as an offence to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How we may know that we grieve for ſin as ſin;</note> 
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But now the ſcruple is, How he may know that he doth grieve for ſin as ſin, and only for ſin?</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> He may know it:</p>

                     <p>Secondly, By the <hi>riſing of grief for ſin,</hi> upon the Aſſurance and Certificate of peace and reconciliation with God, of which the more certain evidence is given into the ſoul, the more ſorrow and grief breaks forth out of the ſoul for ſinning againſt ſuch a God.</p>

                     <p>4. It is a <hi>grief which is vertual; godly ſorrow worketh Repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. <note place="margin">It is a grief which is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</note> 7. 10.

A cordial turning.</note> in the capacity of the promiſe of forgiveneſs of our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is a <hi>cordial turning.</hi> Joel 2. 12. <hi>Turn ye, even to me, with all your heart.</hi> Deut. 30. 10. <hi>If thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi> 2 Chron. 6. 38. <hi>If they return to thee with all their heart, and with all their ſoul.</hi> Ver. 39. <hi>then hear thou from the heavens their prayer, and their ſupplication, and forgive their ſins, &amp;c.</hi> Here are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular expreſſions to ſet forth the life and truth of penitential turning from ſin; <hi>viz.</hi> To turn with the heart, and with all the heart, with all
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55323:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the heart, and with all the ſoul; What may theſe expreſſions mean and ſignifie?</p>
                     <p>There are two things principally intended in them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is a <hi>reality of turning;</hi> for he doth indeed repent, whoſe heart repents; and he doth indeed turn from his ſins, whoſe heart doth turn from ſin; if the heart turns not, the repentance is but feigned and hypocritical: Suppoſe you ſhould for awhile lay ande your ſins, you may therein ſeem unto men to repent; but if you ſtill love your ſins, and hold them faſt, and will not part with them, you are ſo far from repenting in the ſight and account of God, that he looks upon you as plain hypocrites, who pretend only to forſake your ſins, when indeed you are the ſervants of ſin, and intend not at all to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſake them. Well then, to turn from ſin with the heart, is to have an heart giving a Bill of Divorce unto our ſins, breaking the league with ſin, caſting it off for any more love and obedience, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, a <hi>perfection or fulneſs of turning;</hi> that doth the turning with all the heart, and with all the ſoul, and with the whole heart, ſignifie; as when ones whole h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>art is ſet upon an object, or is employed in any ſervice; the meaning is, that every faculty of the ſoul is unitedly and concurrently engaged to that object, and in that ſervice: <hi>I have ſought thee with my whole heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 10. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Not any one faculty of my ſoul, but is drawn out, and exerciſed in that work. So to turn from our ſin with the whole heart (with all the heart, and with all the ſoul) is to have every faculty drawn off from ſin, and diſintereſted of ſin and (as it were) outing and diſcharging it ſelf thereof, all of them agreeing and conſenting to courſe it away; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The underſtanding</hi> ſaith, I will never give way to any deceitful motions of ſin any more, nor to any delightful contemplation of it any more; I will not count it as pleaſure or profit, but ſhall eſteem of it as indeed it is, an object every way to be hated and rejected.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Judgement turns</hi> away from it by diſapproving and diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and condemning of it; I will never reaſon and plead for it more; I will never contrive or deviſe to gratifie it more; I will never make pretences and ſhifts to colour it any more: O it is the greateſt evil, the only diſhonour of God, the only cauſe of the death of Chriſt, and the only danger and damnation of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>conſcience</hi> turns away from it; O ſaith conſcience, ſin hath been the thorn in my eye, and the arrow in my ſide, it hath wounded me, and made me reſtleſs, and filled me with bitterneſs, I will give warning againſt it, I will threaten aganſt it, I will trouble and vex you for it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>will</hi> turns away from it in reſolution and purpoſe; I will never obey ſin any more in the luſts thereof; I will never give over till I find the vertue of Chriſt to crucifie and mortifie them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, And every <hi>affection</hi> of the ſoul turns away from ſin in true repentance.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Love</hi> ſaith, I will never embrace thee more.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Deſire</hi> ſaith, I will never long after thee more.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Delight</hi> ſaith, I will never take content in thee more.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>Hatred</hi> ſaith, I will never be reconciled with thee more.</item>
                        <item>5. <hi>Fear</hi> ſaith, I will watch, leſt the ſoul be ſurprized by thee any more, and I will flye all occaſions, &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>6. <hi>Grief</hi> ſaith, I will mourn and lament, becauſe the ſoul hath been beguiled by thee.</item>
                        <item>7. <hi>Hope</hi> ſaith, I will look up to Chriſt, that the poor ſoul may at length get victory over thee, &amp;c. This is indeed to turn from ſin with the whole heart, and this is the way (certainly) to find forgiveneſs of our ſins; whereas if the heart ſtill retains ſin, and cleaves unto it, our repentance is but feigned, notwithſtanding all the profeſſions we make againſt it; yea, if any one part of the ſoul continue an harbour and refuge to ſin, you do not truly turn from ſin; perhaps you do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for bear ſin but yet you love ſin; perhaps you are ſometimes troubled for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55323:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but yet you will keep ſin; perhaps your judgement condemns your ſins, but yet ſtill your affections run after your ſins; why, this is not a true penitential turning from ſin, &amp;c.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, Looks on the <hi>reaſons of turning from ſin, as univerſally binding his ſoul;</hi> by the ſame reaſon he turns from any one ſin, he ſees reaſon to turn from every ſin. Do you turn from one ſin, becauſe God forbids ſin? why, by the ſame reaſon you are obliged to turn from every ſin: Do you turn from any one ſin, becauſe it is a tranſgreſſion of the holy and righteous will of God? why, by the ſame reaſon you are engaged to turn from every ſin: Do you turn from any one ſin, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you do offend and diſhonour God? by the ſame reaſon you turn from every ſin: Do you turn from any one ſin, becauſe of the curſe which God threatens for that ſin? why, by the ſame reaſon you are to turn from every ſin; for the curſe reacheth to every ſin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Again, <hi>Every penitent perſon is a converted perſon,</hi> (elſe he were not penitent) and every <hi>converted perſon is ſanctified throughout;</hi> he is a new creature; there is a new nature of holineſs diffuſed and ſpread over his whole ſoul; and that new nature of holineſs is contrary to all ſin, as light is to all darkneſs, and heat to all cold; and delivers up the whole heart to God; and this could not be, unleſs it did turn the heart from all ſin.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is in every penitent, a <hi>true hatred of ſin; they hate the thing that is evil, and they loath their abominations,</hi> Pſal. 79. 10. Now hatred is univerſal, it is of the whole kind; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>

                     <p>Secondly, It continues you Impenitent.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Would you have <hi>God to forgive you ſome of your ſins only?</hi> why, any one ſin unforgiven, will undo and damn you; you would have every ſin to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and is it not juſt then that every ſin ſhould be forſaken?</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Do you call theſe ſins ſmall ſins? Read the Scriptures concerning them, and the perſons guilty of them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Know ye not that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with mankind.</hi> Vet. 10. <hi>Nor Thieves, nor Drunkards ſhall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Eph. 5. 5. <hi>This ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean perſon hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words; for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi> Zach. 5. 3. <hi>This is the curſe that goeth forth, Every one that ſtealeth ſhall be cut off on this ſide; and every one that ſweareth, ſhall be cut off on that ſide.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Suppoſe indeed that thy particular ſin (comparatively) were a <hi>ſmall ſin,</hi> yet <hi>thy love of that ſin, and delight</hi> in it, makes that exceedingly hainous, and thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition very dreadful. Is there any thing which God hates but ſin? and which he hath forbidden but ſin? and againſt which he hath revealed his wrath but ſin? and muſt this be the only object of thy love and delight? this which his ſoul abhors, which ſo diſhonours, and provokes, and grieves him, O what a condition is this? to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that which diſhonours thy God? to love that which grieves and provokes God? As <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jonathan, Do I not know that thou haſt choſen the ſon of Jeſſe to thine own confuſion?</hi> 1 Sam. 20. 30. So ſay I, Doſt thou not know that thou loveſt that which will be thy damnation? is there any thing which will damn a man but ſin? and is there any thing which will more certainly do it, than the love of ſin? and is there any thing more inconſiſtent with the nature and practice of true Repentance, than to ſet the heart on ſin?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Of all ſins whatſoever, <hi>the ſins which we have loved and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in are to be forſaken,</hi> if we will approve our ſelves true penitents, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the hopes of pardoning mercies; becauſe 1. Nothing keeps up the power and dominion of ſin, ſo as the love of ſin doth. 2. And nothing continues us in the way and courſe of ſin, ſo much as the love of ſin, &amp;c. 3. Nothing makes us more preſumptuous in ſinning, than the love of ſin. 4. And nothing makes us more to neglect and ſlight the warnings and threatnings, and calls of God, than the love of ſin. 5. And nothing doth more harden the heart in the way of ſin, than the love of ſin. 6. And nothing doth more hinder our hearts to cloſe with Chriſt, than the love of ſin. 7. Nothing doth more provoke God, and render us more obnoxious to the wrath and curſe of God.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, it ſtands in oppoſition, <hi>not</hi> (ſimply) <hi>to falling into ſin;</hi> but (mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dally) <hi>to reſting in ſin,</hi> for that as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks <hi>the juſt falls ſeven times, yet he riſeth up again;</hi> And even this that he will by no means lie in any ſinful act (but ſtill riſeth with renewed Repentance) this ſhews that his heart is fixed.</p>

Therefore Beloved, let us ſadly and ſeriouſly conſider of theſe things which do ſo intimately diſcover the truth of that Repentance, upon which God hath promiſed the forgiveneſs of ſins, that we deceive not, and undo our ſelves at the laſt.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which foliſh and preſumptuous ſinners do make out only in their own fancies.</p>

                        <item>2. Another is, <hi>a Faith of their own,</hi> a confidence however that they ſhall be ſaved, without any doubt or fear.</item>
                        <item>3. A third is, <hi>a Repentance of their own,</hi> which is, I am ſorry, and I forgive all the world, and God be merciful unto my ſoul: But be not deceived, there is more in true Repentance than moſt of us do imagine; This let me faithfully aſſure you of, that,</item>

                        <item>4. If notwithſtanding your profeſſions (nay perhaps your vows) in times of ſickneſs, or danger, or agonies of conſcience to leave your ſins, you do return again unto the ſame courſe of drunkenneſs, of whoredom, of ſwearing, of Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of lying, of ſtealing, of worldlineſs, of pride, of maliciouſneſs, of any known ſin, ſo that you project for it, love it, ſerve it, defend and continue in it; aſſuredly you are no true penitents; and if you ſhould live and dye in ſuch a condition, you will never find God to be merciful unto you in the forgiveneſs of your ſins. And on the contrary, though you have been formerly great tranſgreſſors, even noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners, if now God hath given unto you hearts to ſee, and to bewaile your ſins, and humbly to confeſs them, and to turn from all your wicked wayes with a real purpoſe of heart never to walk in any path of ſin, but in all the paths of Righteouſneſs, God will certainly and accordingly to his many promiſes, forgive you all your ſins.

                        <hi>promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> And for the clear opening of this Concluſion, I will briefly ſpeak unto three things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. There is a neceſſity of Faith, for to enjoy the Remiſſion of our ſinnes.</item>
                        <item>2. That Faith muſt be true Evangelical faith.</item>
                        <item>3. That true Faith may be weak or ſtrong, and whether weak or ſtrong (if it be true) it hath a certainty of forgiveneſs of ſins annexed unto it.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, There is <hi>a neceſſity of Faith for to enjoy the remiſſion of our ſins:</hi> There is <note place="margin">There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſaith for pardon.</note> a neceſſity of the preſence of Faith, and there is a neceſſity of the uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faith.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>A neceſſity of the preſence of Faith:</hi> As repentance muſt neceſſarily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <note place="margin">A neceſſity of the preſence of faith.</note> if you would have your ſins forgiven; ſo faith muſt be neceſſarily preſent in you, if you would enjoy the forgiveneſs of your ſins. Put ſuch a ſuppoſition that, Repentance might be in a perſon without Faith, I dare affirm that the ſins of that perſon ſhould not be forgiven;</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Why, will you ſay, have you not already proved ſeveral promiſes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe upon Repentance!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> True, I have done ſo; I have cleared iti that Remiſſion of ſins is promiſed upon repentance, but not upon repentance as ſeparated from faith; but as repentance is required, ſo is faith required for the forgiveneſſe of ſins: Neither Faith without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor Repentance without Faith, but both of them as inſeparable Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in every perſon whom God will pardon; Nay and it is very convenient or
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:55323:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
uſeful to make compariſons between theſe two graces, in reference unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſins; I humbly conceive that it might eaſily be demonſtrated, that of the two Faith hath the neareſt relation, and is of the ſtronger neceſſity, and of more immediate approach to the forgiveneſs of ſins than Repentance, although both of them are neceſſarily required. But I ſhall not go that way to work, I will only demonſtrate the neceſſity of Faith in us for the forgiveneſs <note place="margin">Five things demonſtrate it.</note> of our ſins; and there are five things which will do that.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The precept of Faith,</hi> in reſpect to our forgiveneſſe; faith is expreſly <note place="margin">The Precept of Faith.</note> commanded. 1 Joh. 3. 23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And it is enjoyned and commanded us, if we would have our ſins forgiven: Acts 13. 38. <hi>Be it known unto you, that through this Name is preached unto you the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> Ver. 39. <hi>And by him all that believe are justified. Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16. 30.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>And the promiſe of forgiveneſſe of ſins upon the condition of Faith:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The promiſe of forgiveneſs upon condition of Faith.</note> Acts 10. 43. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins:</hi> And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we do ſeriouſly conſider the matter, we muſt acknowledge that faith is the only condition of the Covenant of grace, wherein God becomes our God, and we become his people; and by which (therefore) we become heirs of all the promiſes of God, and conſequently of the promiſe of the forgiveneſs of ſins; none are the children of God, and heirs of the Promiſes but by Faith.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is expreſly taken in to the juſtification of a ſinner:</hi> So taken in, that by no other means he can be juſtified, and by this only he muſt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: <note place="margin">It is expreſly taken in to the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſinner.</note> Rom. 3. 28. <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi> Gal. 5. 4. <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect unto you, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace.</hi> You know that the forgiveneſs of our ſins is only in our juſtification, and that the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner is (as to him) only of grace (being juſtified freely by his grace) Rom. 3. 23. And that the ſinner is juſtified by faith, and by faith only, that ſo it may be of grace; and therefore there is a neceſſity of faith for the pardon of ſins, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is <hi>impoſſible to finde remiſſion of our ſins out of Chriſt,</hi> foraſmuch <note place="margin">No remiſſion out of Chriſt.</note> as his blood (only) was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins. Matth. 26. 28. <hi>And in him only we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſins.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 7. <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nd him only hath God ſet forth to be a propitiation, and to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. And it is as impoſſible <hi>to enjoy Chriſt without Faith,</hi> which is the only grace (on our part) to receive Chriſt, to joyn us unto Chriſt, and by which Chriſt doth dwell in us. Now if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the forgiveneſs of ſins, but we muſt firſt have Chriſt, and we cannot have Chriſt but by faith, there is then a neceſſity of faith for the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>If for want of Faith, we ſhall certainly loſe the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> then the preſence of faith is neceſſary for the forgiveneſs of ſins (this Conſequence <note place="margin">For want of Faith we loſe the remiſſion of ſins.</note> cannot be denied by any rational Chriſtian) but the want of faith will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe us the forgiveneſs of ſins; three places will clear that. Mar. 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Joh. 3. 36. <hi>He that believes not, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abides on him.</hi> Joh. 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, you ſhall dye in your ſins,</hi> If for want of faith we dye in our ſins, ſhall not ſee life, ſhall be damned, have the wrath of God ſtill abiding on us, then for want of faith we do certainly loſe the remiſſion of our ſins (for theſe are utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with remiſſion) but you read, that for want of faith we ſhall dye in our ſins, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is a neceſſity of the preſence of Faith for the forgiveneſs of our ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:55323:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. As there is a neceſſity of the preſence of faith, ſo is there <hi>a neceſſity of the uſe or exerciſe of Faith for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> For as in the Covenant of works <note place="margin">A neceſſity of the uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith.</note> actual obedience was neceſſary to enjoy the life then promiſed, ſo in the Covenant of grace actual believing is neceſſary to enjoy Chriſt and forgiveneſs purchaſed by him, and promiſed in him.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two acts of faith (eſpecially) required in every one who would enjoy the forgiveneſs of his ſins.</p>
                     <p>1. One is an <hi>Act of acceptance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The other is an <hi>Act of reliance</hi> on Chriſt only for that forgiveneſſe promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>An Act of acceptance,</hi> his ſoul muſt be brought into Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">An act of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</note> and conſent to receive him, and whole Chriſt with the whole heart. If a man think thus, I will have my ſins forgiven me, but I care not for Chriſt, my heart cannot comply with him, his Commands are too ſtrick, and his wayes are too holy for me, I cannot yield to be his upon ſuch terms as he requires! Let me tell you plainly and faithfully, you ſhall never have your ſins pardoned; why? becauſe the forgiveneſs of ſins is promiſed upon this condition, if you do believe and receive Chriſt. You may as well ſay, that you will be ſaved for ever in heaven, but you will not believe, you will not receive Chriſt, you will not be his. No no, a Communion in what he hath purchaſed cannot poſſibly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a precedent union with himſelf; all the Benefits, and all the Priviledges by Chriſt, are communicable only unto them who are Chriſts; to them there is no condemnation, but, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beſides this Act of acceptance of Chriſt, there muſt be alſo an <note place="margin">An act of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> 
                        <hi>Act of reliance on Christ,</hi> and on him only for the forgiveneſs of your ſins: Put the caſe you do repent of your ſins; yea put the caſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ou do by faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt; if now you do rely on your Repentance, and on your Faith, or on any other thing beſides Chriſt for the forgiveneſs of your ſins, you will certainly loſe the forgiveneſs of them. If you ſhould ſay, God will forgive me for my tears ſake, for my grief ſake, for my confeſſion ſake, for my turning ſake, for my belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſake, but not for Chriſts ſake, you will certainly miſs of pardoning mercy, becauſe all forgiveneſs of ſins unto us, is for Chriſts ſake: Epheſ. 4. 32. <hi>Forgiving one another, as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 12. <hi>Your ſins are forgiven you for his Name ſake.</hi> So then there is a neceſſity of ſuch an act of faith as to rely only on Chriſt, as the reaſon of the pardon of your ſins <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to truſt on his Righteouſneſs, on his Redemption, on his blood only, as the All ſufficicient, and as the effectual reaſon of your forgiveneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond thing which I would ſhew unto you is, <hi>what that Faith is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What that faith is that is ſo neceſſary.</note> 
                        <hi>which is ſo neceſſary for us,</hi> if that we would enjoy the forgiveneſs of our ſins. For as to the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Repentance, we generally grant it for a truth, that men muſt repent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> they will have their ſins forgiven; ſo as to the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of faith it is generally granted that men muſt believe; and if they do truely believe, their ſins ſhall be forgiven. But the difficulty is what this faith is which intitles us unto, and really aſſures remiſſion of ſins: And great reaſon there is to clear this, becauſe of the general confidence in men that they have faith, and becauſe of the ordinary ſelf-deceit of men contenting themſelves with a falſe faith, and becauſe of the dreadful hazard and loſs upon ſuch a miſtake.</p>
                     <p>Therefore rightly to ſtate out unto you this great Point (upon which our life or death depends) lend me your patience and attention while I briefly diſcourſe upon four Concluſions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. All men have not faith.</item>
                        <item>2. All faith brings us not to a certain remiſſion of ſin, although there is a faith which doth ſo.</item>

3. Some men may think they have that faith which doth entitle them unto remiſſion of their ſins, but yet they are deceived.</item>
                        <item>4. That faith which is neceſſary unto the remiſſion of ſins, and infallibly attains it, may be clearly made evident unto us for the truth of its preſence in us.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>All men have not Faith;</hi> So the Apoſtle expreſly, 2 Theſ. 3. 2. <hi>Who hath believed our report!</hi> So the Prophet, Iſa. 53. 1. <hi>He came amongſt his own,</hi>

So ſay I, how ſhall they believe on him whom they have not known? though knowledge may be without Faith, yet it is impoſſible there ſhould be Faith without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The careleſneſſe in many men</hi> about the offer of <hi>Chriſt, and the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christ;</hi> they make <hi>light of them,</hi> Matth. 22. 5. <hi>an know not the day of</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Though ſome men have faith, <hi>yet all Faith doth not bring us to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">All Faith doth not bring us to remiſſion of ſins. A Diabolical Faith.</note> 
                        <hi>the certain remiſſion of ſins.</hi> There are five ſorts of Faith which may be had, and yet no remiſſion of ſins is annexed to any one of them,</p>

They believe that there is a God, and that that wrath which he hath threatned them; ſhall inevitably befall them, and thereupon they tremble; ſuch a kind of Faith many have who do utterly deſpair of mercy, and are without hope.</p>

All theſe Points they do believe to be certain truths, becauſe the Word of God ſaith ſo; and yet for all this their hearts are not drawn to receive Chriſt, nor to love him, nor to ſerve him, without which there is no benefit to be had from Chriſt.</p>

'twixt their hearts and their beloved ſin, and preſſe them to a ſtrictneſſe of holy walking, their Faith will not be able to bring them up to a ſubjection therein unto the will of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>4. Theſe things being premiſed, I now come to ſet out before you that <hi>Faith</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What that Faith is which will certainly get the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins. Faith well ſeated.</note> for the truth and quality of it, <hi>which will certainly get you the remiſſion of your ſins.</hi> That Faith</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It <hi>alwayes follows ſpecial contrition and humiliation for ſin:</hi> For Faith cannot act on Chrſt as a Saviour untill I finde my ſelf a ſinner, needing him to be my Saviour; and therefore the ordinary uſual way of the Spirit, is to convince of ſin, and to lay us low in the ſenſe thereof (and to break down all our high ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and ſelf confidences, that we come to ſee no hope but in the free grace and rich mercy of God in Chriſt) before he conveyes Faith into our ſoules: Luk. 3. 5. <hi>Every mountain and hill ſhall be brought low, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>and all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> Acts 16. 29. <hi>He came in trembling and fell down.</hi> ver. 30. <hi>and ſaid, Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> ver. 31. <hi>and they ſaid, believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Is wrought in us only by the power and mighty working of the Spirit of Chriſt;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Faith rightly cauſed.</note> So the Apoſtle in Epheſ. 1. 19. called there the <hi>exceeding greatneſs of his power,</hi> and <hi>the working of his mighty power:</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt doth accompany and actuate the Goſpel, and it ſets it on upon the heart (for the truth and goodneſs of it) with ſuch Majeſty, Authority, and Efficacy, that the poor ſinner is not able to reſiſt and withſtand the precept of Faith, but is made willing and ready, and yields up his heart to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is alwayes <hi>raiſed by Evangelical offers and premiſes;</hi> when the Lord <note place="margin">And well grounded.</note> works faith indeed, and draws the heart to believe on Chriſt, the heart takes ground and encouragement for this from the <hi>Offers, and Invitations, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> of the Goſpel; <hi>Come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; <hi>this is his Commandement that we ſhould believe.</hi> And from the <hi>Promiſes; He that believes ſhall be ſaved. Come unto me and I will give you reſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In true Faith the <hi>whole heart or ſoul is carried out unto Chriſt:</hi> True believing is a believing with all the heart; the whole heart yields unto Jeſus Chriſt; <note place="margin">And unites the whole heart to whole Chriſt.</note> the <hi>underſtanding</hi> admires at the glory, and at the kindneſs, and goodneſs, and love of Chriſt; the <hi>judgement</hi> is filled with choiſeſt thoughts, and higheſt eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt, None like Chriſt, and none but Chriſt; the <hi>will</hi> falls in with Chriſt freely, readily, fully; O Chriſt, thou art my chiefeſt good and bleſſedneſs; and Chriſt hath all the <hi>affections</hi> of deſire, love, delight, and joy; theſe are taken up and filled with Chriſt, &amp;c. Faith brings in all to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, True <hi>Faith ſincerely ſets up all Chriſt;</hi> takes and ſets up Chriſt as our <hi>Prieſt</hi> for Expiation of ſins, Reconciliation, Interceſſion, and him alone; and as <note place="margin">It ſincerely ſets up all Chriſt.</note> our <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach and inſtruct us; and as our <hi>King</hi> to rule us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his enemies in us, to give us Laws, to receive obedience from us.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, True faith <hi>eternally unites the heart to Chriſt;</hi> neither earthly preferment <note place="margin">It eternally unites to Chriſt.</note> on the one ſide, nor perſecutions and diſcouragements on the other ſide can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the heart of a true believer from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In a word, true faith (which hath the promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins) doth not only know Chriſt, but approves of Chriſt; not only approves of Chriſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt; not ſome of Chriſt, but all Chriſt; not with ſome part of the heart, but with the whole heart; not for a time, but for ever; not upon our conditions, but upon his own conditions; not occaſionally and upon an exigence, but freely and upon choice; not only for ſafety, but alſo for ſervice; nor only for profeſsion, but alſo for union and communion. It matcheth us to Chriſt as a Wife to the Husband; it unites us to Chriſt as Branches to the Vine; it joynes us to Chriſt as Members to the head. Beloved, this is that faith which is neceſſary for the remiſsion of our ſins: If you have not a Faith produced by the mighty
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55323:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
working of the holy Ghoſt; if you have not a faith planted in a broken heart; if you have not a faith grounded on Goſpel-offers and promiſes; if you have not a faith which brings in all your heart to match with Chriſt; if you have not a faith which receives whole Chriſt in all his offers; if you have not a ſaith for ſervice on your part, as well as for benefit on Chriſts part; if you have not a faith which will conform you to Chriſt, as well as apply Chriſt to you, it is but a counterfeit faith; and as it gives you no intereſt in the perſon of Chriſt, ſo it will never intitle and convey unto you any forgiving mercy and ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what that Faith is which is neceſſary for the forgiveneſs of ſins: Now a word to the third Particular, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That <hi>true Faith</hi> (which intitles to the forgiveneſs of ſins) <hi>it may</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">True faith may be either weak or ſtrong.</note> 
                        <hi>be either weak or ſtrong:</hi> Compare believer with believer, there is this latitude in true faith; therefore you read of <hi>great faith</hi> in ſome, and of a <hi>little faith in</hi> others; of ſome whom Chriſt ſtyles his <hi>lambs,</hi> and others his <hi>ſheep;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> calls ſome <hi>young men,</hi> others <hi>little children,</hi> and others <hi>fathers;</hi> there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent meaſures of faith amongſt believers, 1. Partly from the different <hi>impartings of the Spirit,</hi> who is a free and wiſe cauſe; and from partly 2. <hi>The different means</hi> and helps which conduce to the improvement of faith; and 3. Partly from the different <hi>Age and times of faith;</hi> ſome have been long in Chriſt, in others Chriſt is but newly formed; and who can expect that babes newly born ſhould have that ſtrength and ſufficiency as men have who are grown to a riper age? yea, and the ſame faith is in the ſame perſon firſt but weak and tender, <hi>but as the bruiſed reed, but as the ſmoaking flax,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Bur then in the laſt place, (which ſhall cloſe up this Diſcourſe) <note place="margin">Whether it be ſtrong or weak, if it be true, it intitles to pardon.</note> 
                        <hi>whether the faith be ſtrong, or whether it be weak, if yet it be the true Goſpel faith,</hi> (of which I have ſpoken) <hi>it hath a certainty of the forgiveneſs of ſins promiſed and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it.</hi> The Scripture expreſly clears this Concluſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. <hi>Whoſoever believes in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Joh. 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth in him, is not condemned;</hi> why then he is abſolved or pardoned. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12. <hi>I write unto you little children, becauſe your ſins are forgiven you.</hi> Acts 13. 39. <hi>By him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified.</hi> Iſa. 53. 6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there are five clear Demonſtrations of this. <note place="margin">Five Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of it. Every believer is in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Every believer</hi> (whether ſtrong or weak) <hi>is in the Covenant;</hi> God is their God, and they are all of them his people; he is their father, and they are all of them his children. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now every one in Covenant hath the expreſs promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Every believer <hi>is in Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>is in him; Chriſt dwelleth in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">And in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him.</note> 
                        <hi>our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. <hi>and</hi> Gal. 3. 28. ſpeaking of all ſorts of believers, he ſaith, <hi>Ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>What ſhould theſe truths work on all us who have heard the teſtimony of God given in ſo abundantly for them? I will tell you what impreſſion they ſhould make upon us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We ſhould all of us fear and tremble, leſt we ſhould come ſhort of ſuch a mercy which doth ſo nearly, and ſo eternally concern us, as the forgiveneſs of our ſins.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, We ſhould with all carefulneſs and ſeriouſneſs, and ſpeedineſs ſearch our hearts, and try our ways, whether we have attained the grace and practice of true Repentance; and whether true juſtifying faith be in us yea or no; eſpecially conſidering the general courſe of men is impenitency and unbelief; and our own courſes of life have been like that of other men, <hi>a walking</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>in laſciviouſneſs, luſts, exceſs of wine, revellings, banquettings, and abominable Idolatries,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 3. <hi>Fooliſh, diſobedient, deceiving, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another,</hi> Tit. 3. 3.

                     <p>Fourthly, We ſhould be moſt importunately fervent with the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom alone every good and perfect gift doth come; that he would <hi>grant unto us</hi> (as he did unto thoſe Gentiles) <hi>repentance unto life,</hi> Acts 11. 18. and that <hi>it may be given unto us</hi> (as once unto the Philipians) <hi>to believe,</hi> Phil. 1. 29.</p>

Such a kind of ſight of God have juſtified and pardoned perſons here on earth; they may now look on God as their God, as their Father, as loving of them, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, and rejoycing over them to do them good; and what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to come with a filial confidence to ſuch a God and Father?</p>

O Sirs, a loſs, a croſs ſits heavily on the heart, when the guilt of ſin ſits ſtrongly on the conſcience; but if the guilt be taken off there, (as certainly it is upon the forgiveneſs of ſins) then may a man take up the croſs, and kiſs it, then may he ſtoop down, and bear it; then may he take in a mercy, and rejoyce; and then can he give back a mercy, and bleſs, that God who hath given, and now hath taken, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Set this mercy in compariſon with other mercies,</hi> and if you finde juſt cauſe to bleſs God for them, ſurely you will finde more cauſe to bleſs God for this forgiving mercy. You many times bleſs God for delivering your life from death, and have you not more reaſon to bleſs God for delivering your ſouls from hell? You many times bleſs God for delivering your bodies from pains and aches, and have you not more reaſon to bleſs God for delivering your conſcience from wrath and terror? You many times bleſs God for a bleſſing which is but for a time, and but for this life, and have you not more reaſon to bleſs God for this bleſſing of forgiveneſs, which reaches to eternity, and unto everlaſting life?

Now all this would have been the portion of your cup, had not the Lord in much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy pardoned your iniquities and your ſins; for your ſins were of the ſame kind, and of the ſame guilt, and of the ſame deſert as the ſins of others, yet they are condemned, and you are pardoned: They dye, and you live; wrath is inflicted on them, but mercy is beſtowed on you; they ſhall never ſee Heaven, and you ſhall never ſee Hell; they ſhall be damned for ever, and you ſhall be ſaved for ever; they have no reaſon to complain, becauſe the righteous God doth puniſh them (only) for their ſins; and you have reaſon to bleſſe, becauſe the gracious God hath mercifully prdoned your ſins for his own ſake.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond Argument to demonſtrate the total forgiveneſs of ſins <note place="margin">From God himſelf.</note> unto the people of God, ſhall be taken <hi>from God himſelf,</hi> and ſome Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him in a reſpectiveneſs unto his people: Here take notice of five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</p>

aſſure us that God hath mercy, and grace, yet it muſt be the pardon of all our ſins which doth demonſtrate the exceeding riches of his grace: To pardon a few ſins, and to damn us for the reſt, this is not exceeding riches of grace, nor exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundance of mercy, nor exceeding great kindneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reaſons within God himſelf, yea and the Reaſon without God, are both of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The reaſons within God, and without him, are of an univerſal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note>

                     <p>The Reaſon within God himſelf which moves him to forgive the ſins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is <hi>his own love and grace,</hi> they are a ground of perfect mercy and forgiveneſs: Now the ſame love and grace which moveth him to pardon one, doth likewiſe move him to pardon all the ſins of his people.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Reaſon of forgiveneſs without God, which is the meritorious ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, on which God alſo looks (for he forgives us <hi>for Chriſts ſake,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 32.) this is an univerſal motive; for Chriſt did not ſuffer for ſome of the ſins of the Elect, and not for other of their ſins; he did not dye for ſome of the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. This muſt neceſſarily be granted, that when God forgives the ſins of his <note place="margin">Whoſe ſins God forgives, he becomes their friend.</note> people, he doth <hi>then ſhew ſo much of his grace that he now becomes their friend;</hi> and ſo much of his love towards them, <hi>that he ceaſeth to be their enemy:</hi> O but if all their ſins were not forgiven (but if ſome were, and ſome were not) then this inequality of his grace, and partiality of his love, would at the ſame time ſet him out as our friend, and alſo as our enemy; and would alſo at the ſame time ſet us forth as a people of love, and a people of hatred; ſo far as we are forgiven, there you ſee the love of a Father; and ſo far as we are not forgiven, we may alſo ſee the wrath of a Judge.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>He qualifies his people for an univerſal remiſſion of their ſins,</hi> in beſtowing on them ſuch gracious qualities, upon the preſence and actings whereof, he hath <note place="margin">He qualifies his people for an univerſal remiſſion.</note> by promiſe aſſured them of that univerſal Remiſſion: For he hath given ſuch a <hi>Repentance</hi> by which their hearts are turned from the love unto the hatred of all ſin, and from the ſervice of all ſin, to a contrary courſe of new obedience: And upon this doth God expreſly ſettle a forgiveneſs of all ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21, 22. He hath likewiſe given ſuch <hi>a Faith</hi> unto his people which joynes and unites them to Chriſt, and conſequently gives them a full claim unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (Rom. 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith)</hi> Now Juſtification is oppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, Rom. 8. 33, 34. and therefore it carries with it the forgiveneſſe of all ſins.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>There is ſuch a Relation, and ſuch a love between God and his people, as</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The relation and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his people, proves it.</note> 
                        <hi>muſt neceſſarily take in the forgiveneſſe of their ſins:</hi> The relation is very near, and full of love and delight in his people, and they are very dear unto his heart, his ſoul delighteth in them, and all the tokens of his loving kindneſs are ſent unto them, and beſtowed on them; his preſence is with them, and he takes up his habitation in their hearts, he dwells in them; they are his Temples where they meet with him, and he with them. Now none of theſe would be, if yet any of their ſins ſtood before his eyes as unpardoned: For unpardoned ſins make a ſeparation and diſtance, and ſo are contrary to the nearneſs of union; and likewiſe do hold up a difference and an enmity, and ſo the contrary to all gracious communion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A third Argument which may demonſtrate that the forgiveneſs of ſins is univeſal (it is of all ſins) to the people of God, is this, <hi>viz. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, Some are for the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and their opinion is this, that as ſoon as <note place="margin">Some are for the affirmative</note> any are made Believers in Chriſt (and ſo are within the Covenant Actually) all the ſins which they have committed in time paſt, and all the ſins which they are guilty of as to the time preſent, and all the ſins of which they do come to be guilty of in time future, they are actually pardoned unto them, in general and in particular: Neither are Believers ever henceforth to pray unto God for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of any ſin which they do or ſhall commit, but only for the aſſurance of the pardon of them in their own Conſciences; neither is any future Repentance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to attain the forgiveneſs of any new and future ſin; but only for the more comfortable aſſurance of former forgiveneſſe unto our ſelves: Nay Repentance is not required of God as an Antecedent work to pardon of ſins, but only as a conſequent work and fruit thereof, &amp;c. This is their Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Now what might be the ground inducing unto this Opinion, That all the ſins of a believer, not only past, but alſo preſent, and to come, are pardoned ot once, and</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The chief which I do find in writing are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Covenant expreſſions: Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>I, even I am he which blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions</hi> Heb. 8. 12. <hi>I will be merciful unto their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities I will remember no more. Ergo,</hi> all is pardoned at once.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Again, Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And Ver. 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth.</hi> And ver. 38, 39. <hi>Nor things preſent, nor things to come ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> And Joh. 5. 24. <hi>He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlasting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life. Ergo,</hi> all ſinnes are pardoned at once, or elſe they were in a ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A believer (even when he ſinneth) is ſtill united to Chriſt, and is cloathed with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which covers all our ſins, and diſchargeth us from them, ſo that no guilt ſhall redound to us.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A believer is not to fear curſe, or hell at all, which he might do, if all his ſins were not pardoned at once, but ſome of his new ſins were for a while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Repentance is not at all required for our juſtification (where our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is only to be found) but only faith; therefore pardon of ſins is not ſuſpended untill we repent of our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Again, if new ſins were not pardoned untill you do repent, then we ſhould be left to an uncertainty whiles our ſins be pardoned, or when they will be pardoned; for it may be long ere we repent, and more long ere we can know that we do truely repent of our ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:55323:228"/>
Seventhly, If all ſins were not forgiven at once, then juſtification is not perfect at once, but is more and more increaſed and perfected, as more and more ſins are pardoned, which (as they conceive) cannot conſiſt with the true Doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt Arguments which I have read for the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative <note place="margin">Some for the Negative.</note> Opinion, and I have delivered them rather with advantage than with any prejudice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Nevertheleſſe, there are others of the Negative and contrary Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto this, who although they do hold that God hath pardoned all ſins paſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believers (brought into Covenant with Chriſt) and that he will pardon alſo all the ſins of which hereafter they ſhall be guilty, yet they do conjecture, that all theſe are not forgiven (at once) unto them, but upon (though not for) their renewed repentance for them, and upon a renewed act of Faith on Chriſt for the particular forgiveneſs of new and particular tranſgreſſions unto them: Neither do they lay any Popiſh reaſon of worthineſs, or merit in Repentance (as ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly do charge upon them) for the forgiveneſs of any ſin (old or new) but do urge Repentance in relation to forgiveneſs upon thoſe very accounts, which (as they <note place="margin">The grounds for it.</note> conceive) the Scripture promiſes of forgiveneſs do require: Now the Arguments produced for this opinion (that God doth not pardon all ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, at once and together) are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thoſe very Covenant expreſſions reſpecting the pardon of ſin, which the former Opinion uſed to the contrary, <hi>e. g.</hi> Heb. 8. 12. <hi>Their iniquities I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more:</hi> Not to remember iniquity any more, doth (ſay they) in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, ſuppoſe ſay they, that that iniquity was before; for if it never yet was, it cannot be ſaid to be remembred at all, nor to be remembred any more; So that paſſage in Jer. 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity.</hi> and Jer. 33. 8, <hi>I will pardon all their iniquities:</hi> do ſuppoſe an iniquity or offence committed: For if it be not yet committed, how can it be properly ſaid to be forgiven? unleſs (as Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> ſaith) we will make God like the Pope, who aforehand forgave ſins <note place="margin">Of the Coven. Ch. 8 p. 119.</note> to come, which never yet were committed? So Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions:</hi> where pardoning of ſins is compared to the blotting out of debts entred into a book: But ſay they, debts which as yet never were made, may not be entered into the book, and therefore cannot be ſaid to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out; and conſequently ſins yet to come, cannot be ſaid already to be pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, other Sriptures (purpoſely) ſpeaking of the forgiveneſs of ſins, have a reſtrainedneſs unto ſins committed, and look only at them, Jer. 33. 8. <hi>I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned, and whereby they have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt me.</hi> Mark, have ſinned, and have tranſgreſſed! reſpecting the ſins paſt, not what they ſhall commit, which if already forgiven, muſt have come in alſo, which they have ſinned, and which they ſhall ſin. Ezek. 18. 22. <hi>All the tranſgreſſions that he hath committed ſhall not be mentioned unto him.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</hi> Here Chriſt makes interceſſion for ſin as an Advocate, but it is upon this ſuppoſition, <hi>if any man ſin,</hi> as if ſin muſt be committed before he makes Interceſſion for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it: As in the Old Teſtament there were no ſacrifices for any future ſin, but all the ſacrifices for ſin were for ſins already committed ſo; &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe conditional qualifications which God himſelf makes, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the forgiveneſs of ſins (and therefore I wonder how any one dare to call them Popiſh and Antichriſtian) they do neceſſarily ſuppoſe a precedent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins: <hi>vide</hi> 2 Chron. 7. 14. <hi>If my people which were called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I forgive their ſinne.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins,</hi>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:55323:229"/>
                        <hi>he is faithful and juſt to forgive our ſins.</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>He that confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his ſins, ſhall finde mercy.</hi> Acts 3. 19 <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> Mark, if my people ſhall humble themſelves, if they ſhall pray, if they ſhall tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n from their wicked wayes; If we confeſs our ſins, &amp;c. All theſe penitential Qualifications (which God makes Antecedents unto forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) do ſuppoſe a peculiar reſpect unto ſins already committed; for, doth God put us to humble our hearts for ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n which we never yet committed, or for ſins only which we have committed? doth God put it upon us to pray for mercy, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſins which never were, or ſins which have been? would he have us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs theſe ſins which never yet were in being to offend him, or only ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have offended him? doth he at any time enjoyn us to forſake, and turn from ſins which perhaps we never thought on, much leſs actually fell into, or elſe the ſin in which we have walked, and into which we have fallen? Why then, ſay they, if theſe be required for forgiveneſs, and theſe reſpect ſins only that are paſt, then all ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, are not pardoned at once.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If all ſins (paſt, preſent, and to come) are forgiven at once unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, then no believer is to pray unto God for the forgiveneſs of any ſin which he commits after he is once brought in to Chriſt; yet Jeſus Chriſt doth teach even believers to pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> Matth. 6. 12. Luke 11. 4. For he teacheth them thus to pray, who could upon good grounds call God their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which none can but true Believers.</p>
                     <p>Here ſome do think to evade the ſtrength of this Argument by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing 'twixt <hi>pardon of ſin, and the manifeſtation of that pardon unto the ſoule:</hi> They grant that Believers do pray for the pardon of their ſins committed in reſpect of the manifeſtation thereof unto their conſciences, but not for any new act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as unto ſin committed before God.</p>
                     <p>Unto which there is a double Reply.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One, that it cannot eaſily be demonſtrated in Scripture that to pray for the forgiveneſs of ſin, is any where ſo to be taken, as to mean (only) the manifeſtation of forgiveneſs, and not the act of forgiveneſs: And in the Petition (before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) it ſeems it cannot hold: For Chriſt teacheth us to pray unto God, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us;</hi> now our forgiving of their treſpaſſes is not only in way of manifeſtation to the treſpaſſer, but alſo in a real precedent act of condonation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is, that the Saints in Scripture when they ſinned againſt God, did humbly acknowledge their ſins, and did earneſtly pray unto God, firſt, for the pardon of thoſe ſins; and next for the manifeſtation of that pardon; <hi>e. g. David,</hi> in Pſal. 51. 1. prayes expreſly for the pardon of thoſe great ſins which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindneſs, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions:</hi> He uſeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Phraſe, which God himſelf uſeth in his Covenant for the actual fogiving of ſins, <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions,</hi> Iſa. 43. 25. ſo he blotteth out my tranſgreſſions, and not for a meer manifeſtation only. And after this he prayes for the manifeſtation and ſenſe of the forgiveneſs of his ſins, in ver. 8. <hi>Make me to hear joy and gladneſs, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It is poſſible that a believing perſon may fall into ſuch a ſin, or ſins of ſcandal, for which he may be juſtly caſt out from the viſible Church, and upon his neglect of Repentance, or practice of Repentance, he ſtands <hi>bound,</hi> or <hi>looſed</hi> from his ſin, not only <hi>in earth,</hi> but alſo in <hi>heaven;</hi> for ſo Chriſt himſelf delivers it to us, in Matth. 18. 18. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever you ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But this cannot poſſibly be, if all his ſins be already pardoned in heaven; for then he is alwayes looſed, and never bound in heaven. This Argument is of that ſtrength, that I do not ſee how it can be anſwered: for if upon the right ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55323:229"/>
of the Church of Chriſt, the offender is bound in heaven as well as on earth in reſpect of his ſins, then his ſins are not all pardoned at once; and if upon repentance he is looſed in heaven <hi>(i. e.)</hi> abſolved and forgiven, as well as looſed on earth; thence alſo it follows that all his ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, are not at once forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in heaven: take the one or the other, or both, ſtill it ſhakes that Opinion of a forgiveneſſe of all ſins at once.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, If all ſins (paſt, preſent, and to come) are forgiven at once, before they are repented of, then a Regenerate and a juſtified perſon in the midſt of his groſſeſt ſins (as ſuppoſe <hi>Davids</hi> adultery and murder) may joy and rejoyce as much in God, and look on him as well pleaſed, as when they do humble their ſoul, and repent, and ſeek his face.</p>
                     <p>To this one <hi>Francis Cornwell</hi> anſwers freely and plainly; When ſin is moſt <note place="margin">In lib. of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Legal and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal repentance, p. 54.</note> prevalent, and the heart is moſt hardened (he ſpeaks expreſly of Regenerate and juſtified perſons) yet then can they glory in Chriſt Jeſus with a large heart break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into thankſgiving, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Yea, and he that commits a groſs ſin, and doubteth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it, committeth a double ſin; the one againſt his Sanctification, and the other againſt his Juſtification: And what though a believer (uſually upon the <note place="margin">pag. 56.</note> committing of groſs ſins) doubts of his eſtate? this is from a defect in faith, and not from any Rule and Precept of Gods Word.</p>
                     <p>And that it is all one, and alike unto God, when a perſon is humbled, or not humbled; and when he repents and forſakes his groſs ſins, or repents not of them, but continues in them; for all is already pardoned on Gods part, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Seventhly, To theſe another Reaſon may be added, and is added by ſome, that forgiveneſs of ſin is a judicial act in God, as the contrary act of condemning is; now the Judge neither condemns, nor yet forgives offences which are not extant, and which cannot be proved upon the Offender, that ever he was guilty of them: But when they are charged, and pleaded, then doth he condemn or acquit; ſo it would be ſtrange for a Judge to condemn one for faults not committed, and ſo acquit a man for ſins never in being, and ſo not deſerving puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Laſtly, the great and continual work of Chriſt in heaven as our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor and Advocate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2. and the daily ſuing out of pardon in his Name, and for his ſake, ſeems to carry much in it for the acquiring of daily pardon, and continued forgiveneſs of ſins: His great work of Interceſſion and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocater-ſhip, ſurely it contains in it ſomething more than to obtain an aſſurance that all is ſtill pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I delievered unto you the two different Opinions, with their ſeveral Arguments concerning this great Queſtion, whether all the ſins of believers (paſt, preſent, and to come) are pardoned by God at once. Now I ſhall make bold to deliver unto you my own thoughts concerning it, and thoſe different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it. <note place="margin">The truth concerning theſe different Opinions. They agree in five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, I do obſerve that they do both agree in five particulars. <hi>e. g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That as <hi>to Gods eternal decree or purpoſe of forgiveneſſe, all the ſinnes of his people are forgiven.</hi> God did not intend to forgive ſome of their ſins and not the reſt; but an univerſal, and full, and compleat forgiveneſs was fixedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and reſolved on by God.</p>

2. <hi>That all the ſins of his people</hi> (in their abſolute number, from firſt to laſt) <hi>were laid upon Chriſt;</hi> who in the dayes of his ſuffering did meritoriouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe perfect Remiſſion of all their ſins, to be applied in future times to them and by them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That as ſoon as ever any perſon is brought into the Covenant</hi> by believing on Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>all his ſins paſt</hi> (whatſoever they have been) <hi>they are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forgiven unto him,</hi> and God will never remember them any more.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>That as to the ſtate of Juſtification,</hi> there is <hi>a full and perfect remiſſion of all ſins</hi> (conſidered under the differences of time paſt, preſent, and to come) As in the ſtate of condemnation there is not any one thing pardoned, ſo in the ſtate of Juſtification there is not any one ſin but is pardoned; for the eſtate of Juſtification is oppoſite to all condemnation, and curſe, and wrath.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>That no Repentance or work of ours is a meritorious cauſe</hi> (neither God, nor any true believer looks on it as ſo) <hi>of Justification,</hi> or pardon of any ſin; neither the repentance which we call Initial, neither that which we call Renewed; we acknowledge no meritorious cauſe of pardon of ſins, but the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The maine differences which I doe obſerve, do reſt in two <note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt them.</note> things.</p>

                     <p>In this difference, my own judgment inclines to that Opinion which holds, That all the ſins paſt of a Believer are (at once) forgiven, and all his future ſins are remitted unto him upon renewed acts of believing and repenting for Chriſts ſake. If that Opinion be true that Juſtification be one continuing, or continued act, this would reconcile all.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, In that God engageth himſelf by promiſe to forgive all the ſins of all <note place="margin">That God is a God of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy.</note> his people, <hi>This doth manifeſtly declare unto us, that he is a God of infinite mercy;</hi> muſt he not needs be ſo, who forgives ſuch a number of ſins and tranſgreſſions.</p>
                     <p>There are two things which diſcover unto us the infinite fulneſs and depth of mercy in God.</p>
                     <p>One is, that vaſt Title attributed unto him, and his mercy: He is ſaid to be of <hi>great mercy,</hi> Pſal. 105. 8. and to be <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 4. and to be <hi>plenteous in mercy,</hi> Pſal. 86. 15. and to <hi>pardon abundantly,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. 1 Pet. 1, 3. <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his abundant mercy:</hi> and to <hi>keep mercy for thouſands,</hi> Exod. 34. 7. and to be <hi>of everlaſting mercy,</hi> Pſal. 100. 5. and to be of tranſcendent and incomparable mercy <hi>(As the heaven is high above the earth, ſo great is his mercy toward them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 103. 11.) In like manner there are aſcribed to his mercy and mercies <hi>a multitude,</hi> Pſal. 51. 1. <hi>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies. A depth,</hi> Mich. 7. 19. <hi>Thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depth of the ſea.</hi> Not only an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but an <hi>exceeding abundance:</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 14. <hi>The grace of our Lord was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundant.</hi> Nay an <hi>over abundance:</hi> where <hi>ſin abounded, grace did much more abound,</hi> Rom. 5. 23. It did ſuperabound, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2ly The other <hi>is the vaſt quantity of ſinnes</hi> of which the people of God have been guilty: <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19. 12.) <hi>can underſtand his errors? (i. e.)</hi> the number of a mans ſins is ſo numerous, that with all the Arithmetick he hath, he is not able to caſt up how often he hath ſinned. Nay, <hi>David</hi> ſurveying the number of his own ſins, he is non-pluſed, and profeſſeth that they are innumerable, and that they are more than the hairs of his head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. And <hi>Ezra</hi> in his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Chap. 9. 6. <hi>Our iniquities are increaſed over our heads, and our treſpaſſe is grown</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:55323:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>up into the heavens.</hi> Now if the number of ſins in reſpect of one perſon be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable; what then is the number of all the ſins of all the people of God? yet there is mercy enough in God to pardon all and every one of them: To pardon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> their ſinnes which they do know, and all the reſt which they do not know.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In that God doth pardon all the ſins of all his people; this doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcover <hi>the exceeding love and kindneſſe of God to his people:</hi> The Apoſtle <note place="margin">The exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and kindneſs of God to his people.</note> ſaith, in 1 Pet. 4. 8. That <hi>Charity or love covereth a multitude of ſinnes,</hi> and that he that <hi>converts a ſinner, ſhall hide a multitude of ſins,</hi> Jam. 5. 20. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it ſhews exceeding love in God to cover, to blot out, to forget, to paſſe over, to pardon all the multitude of ſins in his own people: To injure God, is infinitely more than to injure man; to offend and diſhonour him, is infinitely more than to offend and diſhonour man; and for God to paſſe by all this, it muſt needs flow from his infinite love and kindneſs; and therefore God is ſaid (Rom. 5. 8.) <hi>To commend</hi> (or highly to exalt) <hi>his love toward us, in that whiles we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us; and to ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindneſs towards us through Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2. 7. <hi>And the forgiveneſſe of our ſins is rightly attributed to the riches of his grace,</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>eſ. 1. 7.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in that God forgives all the ſins of all his people, this may inform us, <note place="margin">What a heavy weight did lie upon Chriſt.</note> 
                        <hi>What an heavy weight did lie upon Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of that wonderful power and vertue of his ſufferings. There is no man who is able to expreſs the ſurpaſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and burden in any one particular ſin: we finde (many times) that ſome one ſin (ſet on with the wrath of God) doth drive us to our feet; it is more unto us than the ſhadows of death; it doth fill us with ſuch diſtractions and horror, that we can neither live nor dye; we are not able to ſuſtain it, nor yet to decline it: what work then would all our ſins make within us, if the Lord ſhould in wrath return them upon us? Now all the ſins of all the people of God (from the beginning of the world to the end thereof) were in all their kinds, and numbers, and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions laid upon Jeſus Chriſt, he bare all our ſins; he was made ſin for us, and a curſe for us: How heavy was this burden, all the ſins of all the Elect (at once) lying upon him! and all the curſe, and all the wrath due unto thoſe ſins (at once alſo) lying upon him! no marvel that he did <hi>ſweat drops of blood, and cryed out, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And yet all this he went through, and ſo endured, as that he ſatisfied the very Juſtice of God for all theſe ſins, and purchaſed the diſcharge or forgiveneſs of all thoſe ſins, which he could never have done, had he not been both God and Man, and of infinite dignity, and merit, and power.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This likewiſe may inform the people of God, <hi>what exceeding Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he upon us unto our God.</note> 
                        <hi>do lie upon their ſoules unto their God, who forgiveth all their iniquities, tranſgr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſſions and ſinnes,</hi> Pſal. 103. 2. When ſome few of them heretofore fell into your Conſciences, you would have given (if you had poſſeſſed it) all the world to have gained but a hopefull poſſibility and probability of pardoning mercy; but now you are come to a <hi>certainty,</hi> the Lord himſelf aſſures you in his word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will forgive, not a few ſins only, but all your ſins; O beloved, how ſhould your ſouls love your God, and bleſs your God who forgives all your ſins, and caſts them all into the depths of the Sea! why, every one of your ſins would have been the loſs of heaven, and a curſe, and an hell, and a damnation, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wrath unto you, had not the Lord been mercifull unto you in the forgiveneſs of it, or them: But now God will diſcharge you of all, and blot out all, ſo that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you cannot be, and ſaved you ſhall be; O the depth of love and mercy, and kindneſs to your ſouls! meditate more of them, be taken up more with them, and as you are the only objects of riches of mercy, ſo ſtrive to expreſs your ſelves the choiſeſt people in exactneſs of love and life anſwerable to your mercy:</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This (that God promiſeth to pardon all the ſins of all his people) may <note place="margin">A multitude of ſins is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with pardoning mercy.</note> likewiſe inform us that no, <hi>not a mltitude of ſins</hi> (though the number be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ind large and exceedingly increaſed) <hi>Is allwayes an abſolute prejudice</hi>
                        <pb n="433" facs="tcp:55323:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>or bar, or inconſistent with pardoning mercy;</hi> this conſequence is clear and ſound; for if God will pardon all the ſins of all his people, and their ſins are multitudes of ſins, and (in ſome ſort) innumerable, then certainly a large number of ſinnings is not abſolutely inconſiſtent with forgiveneſs; not that every one who is guilty of a number or multitude of ſins, is, or ſhall be certainly forgiven; but that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſins is not an abſolute bar or excluſion, ſo as to make the condition hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unpardonable: <hi>All manter of ſin and blaſphemy</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be forgiven unto men; but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men,</hi> Matth. 12. 31. where he plainly expreſſeth a capability of forgiveneſs for any ſin or ſins, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt only excepted; which may be a ſingular preſervation againſt deſpair, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They have not meerly a ſingle promiſe</hi> from God to this purpoſe, (which yet were ſufficient warrant) but <hi>manifold promiſes;</hi> they have the ſame promiſe multiplied, often tranſcribed, and that not darkly and doubtfully, but clearly and plainly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8. <hi>Micah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 7. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They are the very people unto whom this renewed promiſe is made;</hi> they are believers, they are converted and renewed, they have the very Characters of the Covenant ſtamped and ſealed upon their hearts and lives.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They have Jeſus Chriſt (1. In his Perſon. 2. Mediatorſhip. 3. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. 4. Benefits.) to be their Mediator both of Redemption and Interceſſion, who <hi>was once offered to bear the ſins of many,</hi> Hebr. 9. 28. and <hi>is entered into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Ver. 24.

                        <item>3. They ſtick a long time upon ſome particular ſins, and are in long debates concerning the intention and will of Divine mercy as to the pardon of them; yea, and conclude very often that the Lord will never paſs them by.</item>
                        <item>4. Upon new commiſſions, they are ſo far from believing their pardon, that they do queſtion whether God hath (indeed) pardoned their old and former tranſgreſtions.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is (unqueſtionably) a <hi>very difficult matter for any one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is a difficult matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</note> 
                        <hi>that God will forgive all his ſins,</hi> eſpecially when a perſon doth diſtinctly and ſeriouſly conſider them in their number and circumſtances, and the heart is really ſenſible of the injuries againſt God in them. O how much oft-times hath he been provoked and diſhonoured! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold of me, ſo that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> Mark, he is not able to look up, and his heart faileth him: O thinks he, here is ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſins indeed; will the Lord ever pardon all theſe? I fear he will not, I can hardly believe that he will.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which make it ſo difficult to believe that God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all our ſins.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The weakneſs of faith,</hi> which cannot preſently apprehend and reach the heighth and depth, and breadth, and lenght of the love and mercy of God; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> a weak faith is like a weak eye, which cannot behold the Sun in its glory; ſo weak faith cannot ſo well behold God in the glorious manifeſtations of his exceedingly abundant grace; but dazzles and doubts, Is there ſuch a treaſury of mercies for a ſinner? is there enough in Chriſt for all theſe ſins?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The tenderneſs of conſcience,</hi> which being very ſenſible of a multitude of ſins, and feeling Gods diſpleaſure and anger, raiſeth ſtrong fears and exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt univerſal forgiveneſs of all our ſins; Shall I find mercy, who do feel wrath? Can I be perſwaded that God will ſpeak forgiveneſs to all my ſins, who do find him ſpeaking ſuch bitter things for ſome of my ſins? will he ever diſcharge me of all my ſins, who doth charge my ſins with that ſtrong diſpleaſure upon my ſoul?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſtrong and manifold, and ſubtile temptations and ſuggeſtions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> who knows how to heighten our ſins, and to diminiſh the mercies of God, when he would bring us to deſpair; as he doth know alſo how to diminiſh our ſins, and enlarge mercy when he would draw us to preſumption. O ſaith Satan, here are ſuch ſins, and here are ſo many of them, that here is no hope at all for mercy; the <hi>wrath of God</hi> (you know) <hi>is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs, and all unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. For ſome of theſe ſins hath God (long ſince) deſtroyed and damned multitudes of men. What then will he do to you for all theſe ſins? here is ſin upon ſin, and nothing but ſin (without any interruption, and without any ceſſation) for twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are committed againſt many threatnings, warnings, examples, puniſhments, yea, and againſt many calls of mercy, and offers of grace, which had they been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in time, there might have been ſome hope; but you went on, and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your tranſgreſſions againſt all theſe; therefore for ſuch a multitude of ſins no mercy will be found. 'Tis true, that God hath promiſed to pardon all the ſins of his people; but you are none of that number; had you been ſo, would you, or durſt you thus to have multiplied and increaſed your tranſgreſſions againſt ſuch a God? you would have repented long ago; and beſides all this, think you that you ſhould not have had news of forgiveneſs, (after ſo many tears and prayers, and hearknings, and waitings) if God would have forgave thoſe ſins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:55323:232"/>
Fourthly, Though it be very difficult to believe that God will forgive all our <note place="margin">Yet it is very neceſſary to believe this promiſe.</note> ſins, <hi>yet it is very neceſſary to believe this promiſe of God,</hi> and that upon a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The honour of God,</hi> which is as much concerned in this Branch of the Covenant, as in any other; he doth lay forth in it (as I hinted before) the riches of his grace, and the glory of his great goodneſs, and his heart of mercies to the very full; and beſides this, he ſeals this part of his Covenant with the ſame infallibility of truth, and ratifies it with the ſame blood of Chriſt, which though it reſpects the ſtabliſhing of the whole Covenant, yet it is more frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to confirme the Branch of the forgiveneſs of ſins, as you may ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that our faith might be the more ſtrengthened, and ſo give unto God the more glory in and for ſuch a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth. And let me tell you one thing, that what ground you have to believe that God will forgive you any one of your ſins, the very ſame you have to believe that he will forgive you all your ſins; and upon the ſame reaſon that you believe not the promiſe as to the forgiveneſs of all your ſins, upon the ſame reaſon you muſt deny belief of the promiſe as to the forgiveneſs of any one ſin; and ſo God loſe all the glory of his rich mercies by your unbelief.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The peace of your own conſciences;</hi> for ſuppoſe you did believe that God would forgive ſome of your ſins, but ſome others of your ſins he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; could this partial forgiveneſs ſettle and quiet your conſciences? would they not hold you under as much fear and bondage, as if not one of your ſins were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given? ſurely it would, becauſe there is ſtill in any unforgiven ſins ſo much guilt and merit as will ſerve effectually to the everlaſting deſtruction of your ſouls and bodies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The renewing of you again to repentance,</hi> and bringing of you back again unto God; for ſuppoſe you confine your faith to believe that God will pardon the ſins which you have committed in time paſt, and beyond this your faith will not ſtir; tell me then I beſeech you, what will you do for the ſins you have committed ſince converſion? will you have them pardoned, or will you not have them pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? will you go on in them, or will you forſake them? will you ſtill go away, or will you return to your firſt husband? ſurely you would have them pardoned; ſurely you would renew repentance, and return to the Lord your God; but how can this be, if you cannot, or will not believe that God will forgive thoſe ſins as well as the former? If you be perſwaded that forgiving mercy is at an end, and God hath no more mercy to forgive any more ſins, I dare aſſure you that where the hope of mercy ceaſeth, there the practice of repentance will ceaſe: But on the contrary, when you can by faith ſee God willing and ready to pardon you, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of you, this will melt, and this will move your hearts to repent, and to return unto the Lord, &amp;c. God hath yet thoughts of mercy towards me; <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my Father, and ſay, Father, I have ſinned againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, And this leads me unto the next Branch of the Exhortation, which <note place="margin">Make uſe of this truth.</note> is, that we muſt not only believe that God will forgive us all our ſins, but we muſt <hi>make uſe of this truth</hi> in all our occaſions. What one day of our life; have we not occaſion to make uſe thereof? After converſion there are two ſorts of ſins incident unto us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Daily ſins of ignorance and infirmity;</hi> and they are ſo many, that we know not the number of them; yet all of them do need forgiving mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Voluntary ſins,</hi> and of a very groſs and hainous nature, which make a deep wound, and raiſe an hideous cry in the conſcience, and ſhake all our founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and lie as an heavy burden upon us; and they do the more wound and afflict us, becauſe committed after mercy, and againſt mercy. Now in ſuch a ſelf-wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſelf-judging, and ſelf-humbling condition, what ſhould the aſhamed and confounded ſinner do? why, he ſhould return ſpeedily to his God, and with tears
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55323:233"/>
and ſhame ſpread his ſins before the Lord, and acknowledge that he is unworthy of any more mercy, and yet beſeech the Lord to ſhew him mercy again, who hath promiſed to forgive all the ſins of his people; and he ſhould <hi>hearken what God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, but let them return no more to folly,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8.</p>

Sixthly, Of all ſins theſe are the moſt <hi>brutiſh,</hi> making perſons like the beaſts; and therefore in Scripture unclean and adulterous perſons are compared to beaſts.

                     <p>Seventhly, Adultery in ſome reſpect <hi>is worſe than many other ſins</hi> againſt our Neighbours; it is a very great ſin to ſlander the name of our Neighbour, and to bear falſe witneſs againſt him; it is very bad by theft to take away the goods of our Neighbour; it is yet worſe to kill and take away the life of our Neighbour; but adultery is (in ſome reſpect) more ſinful than any one of theſe. <hi>v. g.</hi> In all theſe ſinnings, the perſon ſinning brings a guilt only upon himſelf; for when he defames another, though he caſts reproach on him, yet he makes him not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in ſtealing from another, though he brings loſs to him, yet he makes him not guilty; and when he kills another, he brings death to him, yet he makes him not ſinfully guilty; but in adultery, there is a mutual conſent to ſin, and a mutual contract of guilt; and although the one party ſhould repent, and ſo eſcape wrath, yet the other party repenting not, hath a ſoul which (for this ſin) muſt be caſt into hell.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, They are ſuch ſins, for which <hi>God himſelf will judge the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,</hi> though poſſibly they may eſcape the hands of men. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and adulterers God will judge;</hi> and verily God hath ſeverely judged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for theſe ſins, even in this life. <hi>The Old World</hi> was drowned for them, <hi>Gen</hi> 6. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>By Gods ſingular detestation,</hi> and loathing of Idolatry and Idols: Idols are frequently in Scripture called <hi>abominations,</hi> 1 King. 11. 5. <hi>Solomon went after</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By Gods ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</note> 
                        <hi>Milcom the abomination of the Amorites.</hi> Verſe 7. <hi>And he built an high place for Chemoſh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.</hi> Idolatries are called <hi>abominable Idolatries,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 3. which the Learned call <hi>Epithetum perpetuum &amp; non diſtinguens;</hi> ſee Acts 15. 20. <hi>That they abſtain from pollutions of Idols,</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, filthineſſes, defilements: Therefore Idols are called dunghill-gods, ſtinking, filthy, and defiling.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>By Gods ſpecial warnings of his people against this ſin of Idolatry.</hi> Jer. 44. 4. <hi>Do not this abominable thing which I hate.</hi> Deut. 18. 9. <hi>When thou art come <note place="margin">By Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial warnings.</note> into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou ſhalt not do after the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe Nations.</hi> Deut. 4. 23. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, leſt you forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you, and make you a graven image, the likeneſſe of any thing which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 14. <hi>Flee from Idolatry.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By the <hi>grievous threatnings of Idolaters;</hi> read at your leaſure, Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. <note place="margin">By grievous threatnings.</note> 15. <hi>He forſook God.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>they provoked him to jealouſie with strange gods.</hi> (and ver. 19. <hi>and when the Lord ſaw it, be abhorred them.)</hi> and ver. 20. <hi>and I will hide my face from you,</hi> and ver. 22. <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt hell.</hi> ver. 23. <hi>I will heap miſchief upon them, and will ſpend my arrows upon them.</hi> ver, 24. <hi>they ſhall be burnt with thunder, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter deſtruction.</hi> ver. 25. <hi>The ſword without, and terror within ſhall deſtroy, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By the unparallel'd judgments on Idolaters; God hath given the bill <note place="margin">By unparalleld judgements on Idolaters.</note> of divorce and broken them in pieces, and rooted them out of their dwelling places, and ſcattered them over all the earth, and perſecuted them in his wrath, untill he hath deſtroyed them from off the face of all the earth.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, And beſides all this, <hi>he hath ſhut the dore of heaven againſt Idolaters,</hi> and threatens them with no leſs then hell and damnation, and the lake that burns <note place="margin">The dore of heaven is ſhut againſt them.</note> with fire and brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, But once more conſider <hi>the nature or effect of this ſin of Idolatry;</hi> it is ſo every way contrary to Gods glory of which he is moſt tender, Iſa. 48 11. <note place="margin">The nature or effects of this ſin.</note> and Iſa. 42. 8. <hi>and will not give it to graven images:</hi> It is the changing of his glory <hi>(They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beaſts, and creeping things,</hi> Rom. 1. 23.) and the ſordid abaſing of his glory to imagin any creature capable of that excellency, and of that worſhip which belongeth to God; and verily we do no leſs
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55323:235"/>
than make the creatures to be God, when we do conferre on them that worſhip which is proper unto God, or ſuppoſe ſuch excellencies to be in them, which are to be found only in God.</p>
                     <p>It is the <hi>exceeding provocation of God,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 14. <hi>Ephraim provoked him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger moſt bitterly; therefore he ſhall leave his bloud upon him. Idolatry</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often called <hi>adultery,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> are ſaid to <hi>commit adultery</hi> with ſtocks and ſtones; what greater offence and provocation in a wife than to forſake her husband, and to play the adultreſs with ſtrangers? the Lord for this ſin of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath utterly forſaken people, he would be their God no more, nor would he own them for his people any longer. Nevertheleſs though this ſin of Idolatry is ſo exceedingly high and provoking, yet God hath pardoned it unto his people: He pardoned it to <hi>Abraham, Solomon,</hi> to all the Churches of the Gentiles; to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Epheſians, Galatians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee the Aſſertion evinced from the Text.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſhall in the next place evince it from <hi>other places of Scripture,</hi> that <note place="margin">From other Scriptures.</note> God will forgive the greateſt ſinnes, &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1. 13. <hi>Who was before a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and a perſecutor, and injurious, but I obtained mercy.</hi> O what ſins were theſe? <hi>blaſphemy, perſecution, injuriouſneſs,</hi> even to baniſhment and death! <hi>but I obtained mercy:</hi> In Acts 3. 14. <hi>And ye denyed the Holy One, and deſired a murderer to be granted unto you.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>and killed the Prince of life.</hi> yet Acts 44. <hi>Many of them which heard the Word believed, and the number of men were about five thouſand.</hi> Iſa. 1. 18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Let us ſee it further demonſtrated by ſome Arguments. <note place="margin">Arguments to demonſtrate it. God is great in mercy.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>God is great in mercy; Who is a strong God like unto thee, that pardoneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his heritage!</hi> Micah 7. 8. <hi>Grave eſt quod habeo, ſed ad Omnipotentem confugio,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Infinite mercy can forgive great iniquity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſatisfactions of Chriſt are great aad full;</hi> ſo that by them grace did <note place="margin">Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is great.</note> ſuper abound: He undertook the whole ſtate of the ſins of Gods people; ſins great and ſmall, many and few, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gnorance and knowledge, all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and all their treſpaſſes, and all their tranſgreſſions: and did ſatisfie the Juſtice of God fully, and to the utmoſt, ſo that in him there is plenteous Redemption: The obedience of Chriſt is as much above our ſins, as his perſon is above our perſons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Lord <hi>calls upon people to repent,</hi> as therein he deals with them to leave and <hi>forſake all their ſins, great and ſmall</hi> (he excuſes them in no one <note place="margin">God calls us to repent of great ſins, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth pardon</note> ſin) but of all ſinnes he preſſeth them to forſake their great ſins; ſo to draw and encourage them to this repentance he doth hold out <hi>his promiſe of pardon indefinitely of all their ſins;</hi> this Covenant makes no diſtinction at all twixt ſmall and great: God (uſually) inſtances in the greateſt ſins.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>God by the Goſpel gathers of all ſorts into his kingdom;</hi> The notorious <note place="margin">God gathers all ſorts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> ſinners as well as the civil ſinner <hi>(Mary Magdalen</hi> as well as <hi>Lydia, Saul</hi> as well as <hi>Nicodemus)</hi> great ſinners as well as ſmall offenders. But unleſs God would pardon great ſinners, the Goſpel cannot invite all ſorts of ſinners: For when you preach it to perſons guilty of great ſins, alas ſay they, mercy belongs not to us, and what have you to do to preſs upon us to believe? ſuppoſe we ſhould believe, yet we ſhall not be ſaved, God will never juſtifie and pardon us, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God brings great ſinners into Covenant, Publicans, Harlots; and when <note place="margin">God brings great ſinners into Covenant in a perfect league of love and peace.</note> God brings any (actually) into the Covenant, there is <hi>a perfect league of love and peace</hi> made between them; a mutual reconciliation and relation; therefore he pardons their great ſins: For unleſs theſe were pardoned, ſuch a league of love and peace would be impoſſible: Perſons are not perfectly reconciled, whileſt the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55323:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greateſt matters of difference do continue.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Son,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>be of good comfort, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> Matth. 9. 2. <note place="margin">Every juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>God hath made uſe of the great ſins of perſons to humble them;</hi> and will he not <note place="margin">God makes uſe of great ſins to humble men</note> now make uſe of his great mercies to pardon them? all our humbings are wrought by the Spirit, in a reference unto mercy: when God intends to make us <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> he doth firſt make us <hi>broken</hi> veſſels: Acts 2. 37. <hi>Pricked in their hearts.</hi> Ver. 41. then <hi>believed.</hi> Acts 9. 6. <hi>Trembled.</hi> Chap. 16. 29. And when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to break and humble the heart of a ſinner, uſually he makes the Conſcience of him to apprehend and to lay hold of ſome of the greateſt and worſt of his ſins. <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience took hold of his perſecuting of Chriſt, and the Jaylor of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſneſs to the Apoſtles; <hi>Zacheus</hi> on his exaction, and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> on her adultery. God layes on us the ſenſe of our great ſins, to make us ſee the great need of mercy, and to confeſs the greatneſs of mercy in the pardoning of ſuch great ſins, and to quicken earneſt prayers for mercy.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>God hath great glory in the pardon of great ſins: Who, is a God like unto thee, &amp;c?</hi> Mich. 7. 19. <hi>q. d.</hi> there is not ſuch a merciful and gracious God in all the <note place="margin">God hath great glory in the pardon of great ſins.</note> world. Prov. 25. 2. <hi>It is the glory of God to conceale a thing.</hi> Prov. 19. 11. <hi>It is the glory of a man to paſſe over a tranſgreſſion.</hi> So Jer. 33. 8. <hi>I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have ſinned, and whereby they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>And this ſhal be to me a Name of joy, and praiſe, and honour before all the Nation.</hi> This was his glory: Exod. 34. 7. <hi>Keeping mercy for thouſands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>God would have his people to pray for the forgiveneſs of their great ſinnes:</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That he takes not advantage againſt them;</hi> he ſeeks not occaſions to fall off from them: if he did, then ſmall offences would ſerve the turn; our daily fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would have broken up all communions betwixt him and us; much more would our great tranſgreſſions have raiſed up a partition wall, and cauſed his ſoul to abhor us: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 10. <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</hi> Great tranſgreſſions are great provocations, and great injuries, and great diſhonours unto God; yet you ſee he promiſeth to paſs them by, to pardon them; therefore certainly he takes no advantage againſt us, he doth not mark iniquities and what we have done amiſs. <note place="margin">There are no ſmall matters God doth for us.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>That they are no ſmall matters which he doth for us:</hi> There are two things which God doth for his people which are not ſmall favours.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is the giving of Chriſt unto them, and the giving of them unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is the forgiving of their great ſins: <hi>Moſes</hi> reputes this work as
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55323:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fruits of his great power, and of his great mercy; Numb. 14. 17. <hi>I beſeech thee let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, ſaying,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>Pardon the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> And ſo doth the Apoſtle, in Epheſ. 1 17. He puts this upon the account of the <hi>riches of Gods grace,</hi> wherein (ver. 8.) <hi>he abounds towards us.</hi> Was it a ſmall thing for the King (in Matth. 18. 23, 24.) <hi>to forgive the ſervant who owed unto him ten thouſand talents?</hi> What is the deſert of any one ſin, even of the leaſt of our ſins? death, and wrath, and curſe, and hell; what then is the puniſhment and recompence meritoriouſly belonging to us for our great tranſgreſſions? yet God forgives them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That his love is very great, and very firm, and ſure unto his people;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">His love is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and firm.</note> and never to be taken off and removed; why ſo? becauſe he forgives all the ſins of his people, and the great, and the greateſt ſins of them. If any thing breaks off the love of God, it muſt be ſin (for that he hates, and that is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provocation of him) and if any ſin doth it, it is likely that a multitude of ſins will, (daily and continual offences) and if any of theſe will, it is moſt probable, that great and high ſinnings will cut the knot aſunder. But you ſee it is not the multitude of ſins, nor yet the magnitude of ſins which ſeparates the people of God from the love of God, but he will pardon all their ſins, yea the greateſt of their ſins; therefore his love is fixed, and never to be changed: For if theſe will not alter it, nothing elſe ſhall, or can.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>That God takes away all grounds of deſpair</hi> from the hearts of his people: There are but three principal grounds of deſpair; <note place="margin">God takes away the grounds of deſpair.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. O my ſins are ſo many, that there is no hope of mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. O but my ſins are ſo high, and ſo great, that God will never forgive them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. O but though God can and will forgive many ſins, and great ſins; yet he will not forgive my great ſins: <hi>My ſin,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cain, is greater than ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi> Gen. 4. Now God anſwers all theſe Arguments and Grounds of deſpair which poſſibly may ariſe in the hearts of his people; For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He promiſeth that <hi>he will forgive all their ſins, and will caſt them alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of the ſea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. He promiſeth to forgive their great ſins; <hi>though they have been as ſcarlet, and red like crimſon, and though adulterers, and though idolaters, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This promiſe he himſelf doth make, with reſpect unto every one of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as you may ſee here in the Text, and in other Scriptures; So that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no ground at all of deſpair for them: Indeed there may be matter enough for their humiliation, but none for deſperation.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>After their converſion,</hi> they have alſo been guilty of great ſins. <hi>Noah</hi> of <hi>drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Gen. 9. 21. <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>inceſt</hi> with his own daughters, Gen. 19. 35, 36. <hi>Solomon</hi> of abominable <hi>Idolatries,</hi> 1 Kin. 11. 6, 7. and <hi>David</hi> of <hi>adultery</hi> and <hi>murder,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 4. 12. 9. And a thouſand to one but moſt of us have been guilty of ſome great ſin or other, either for the kind of it, or for the circumſtantial aggravations of it, either of Omiſſion, or of Commiſſion: ſo that we all have cauſe to look after the forgiveneſs of great ſins.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Their great ſins do diſhonor God</hi> as much, nay more <hi>than the great ſins of others.</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 14. <hi>By this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Their great ſins diſhonor God as much, if not more than others.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Lord to blaſpheme, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 2. 24. <hi>The Name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles through you.</hi> Yea they do exceedingly provoke God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his comfortable preſence of joy from their ſpirits, and to ſpeak bitter things unto them, and to correct them with a ſtrong and exemplary chaſtiſement, and to ſuffer them to be buffeted by Satan with very heavy and diſtracting temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: upon this accout alſo they have reaſon to look after the forgiveneſſe of their great ſins.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Apprehenſions of their great ſins as unpardoned muſt needs fill their hearts with marvellous fears, and their Conſciences with unutterable unquietneſſes</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe ſins will fill their hearts with fears.</note> 
                        <hi>and burdens;</hi> as in <hi>Davids</hi> roarings, and his complaint of broken bones. There is (I think) not any one perſon whoſe great ſins have not (at ſome time or other) returned upon him, and deeply wounded him. Great ſins (of all other) are certain terrors unto the Conſcience; and of all great ſins, theſe are ſo. 1. The <hi>ſins againſt nature.</hi> 2. Thoſe of <hi>groſſe uncleanneſs.</hi> 3. Thoſe of <hi>blood and murder.</hi> 4. Thoſe of <hi>compact with the Divel.</hi> 5. Thoſe of <hi>blaſphemy.</hi> 6. Thoſe againſt the <hi>workings of Conſcience.</hi> 7. Thoſe <hi>againſt the Goſpel.</hi> 8. <hi>Preſumptions.</hi> 9. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes.</hi> Any of theſe, and any other great ſins of which one hath been guilty, they ſit heavy upon the Conſcience, and do make dreadful work there, and do often ariſe with exceeding terror and diſtraction, ſo that the ſoul ſinks under the guilt of them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There <hi>is nothing whatſoever which can allay and quiet Conſcience troubled, and troubling for the guilt of great ſins, but the preſence or (at leaſt)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Nothing can allay thoſe fears, but the ſenſe or hope of pardon.</note> 
                        <hi>the hope of forgiveneſs of them:</hi> No earthly thing can quiet conſcience in that condition; <hi>David</hi> wanted not for them, and yet he <hi>roared all the Day long,</hi> and his <hi>bones waxed old, and his moiſture was turned into the drought of ſummer,</hi> Pſal. 32. 34. Nay (let me ſpeak a bold word) there is nothing in God which can do it, but this merciful and gracious nature to forgive: If the diſtreſſed ſinner looks on his Juſtice, he falls down confounded; if he looks on his holineſs, O he is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold ſinne!</hi> if on his power, O it <hi>is a fearful thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the living God!</hi> Nothing but mercy anſwers this diſtreſs, or
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55323:237"/>
gives eaſe to this pain and trouble: <hi>Be mercifull unto me, O God,</hi> ſaid <hi>David; God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Publican; Take away iniquity</hi> ſaid the Church: Beloved! In all ſorts of diſtreſs, there is but one thing which is a proper relief: In ſickneſs, health is the only help; in hunger, bread is the only help; in thirſt, water is the only help; in pains, eaſe is the only help; and ſo under the guilt of ſin, mercy is the only help: This is life, this is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, this is all.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Though your ſins have been, or are very great, yet there is hope of mercy,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Though your ſins be great, yet there is hope of mercy.</note> and that for you; which may appear briefly by four particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>promiſe of God reaches</hi> (as you have heard) to the pardon of great ſins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The inſtances or acts of mercy,</hi> they are recorded, grants of grace and mercy to great tranſgreſſions: You know thus they have paſſed to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> As great ſins as yours hath God pardoned, yea and perhaps greater ſins than yours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>God is still of a merciful nature;</hi> he is as able, and as ready to forgive as ever; the Fountain is as full, and as open; Although the Lord hath ſhewn mercy to many and great ſinners already, yet he reſerves and <hi>keeps mercy for thouſands,</hi> nay for a thouſand generations. You are not the firſt great ſinners, nor yet the laſt great ſinners, on whom he hath, or on whom he will ſhew mercy; <hi>his mercy endures for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>He calls upon ſuch as have been guilty of great ſins, to leave their ſins,</hi> and to <hi>come in unto him;</hi> and hath aſſured them that if they do ſo, he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give their great ſins. Iſa. 1. 10. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord ye Rulers of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ye people of Gomorrah.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>Your hands are full of blood.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>learn to do well, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> Jer. 3. 1. <hi>They ſay, If a man put away his wife, and ſhe go away from him, and ſhe become another mans, ſhall he return again unto her? ſhall not that Land be greatly polluted? but thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Will he reſerve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end; behold thou haſt ſpoken and done evil things as thou couldeſt.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>And I ſaid after ſhe had done all theſe things, turn thou unto me, but ſhe returned not.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>Return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, for I am mercifull, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, I now proceed to lay down ſome Directions, what one ſhould <note place="margin">Directions how to get the pardon of great ſins.</note> do who hath been guilty of great ſins, to get the pardon of them.</p>
                     <p>I will propoſe unto you no other Courſe or Practice than what you may read in the Scriptures, that ſome have taken who have been guilty of great ſins, and have thereupon found mercy in the pardoning of them.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Whats that? will you ſay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> You ſhall find</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That they have been <hi>greatly humbled, and have greatly mourned</hi> for <note place="margin">Be greatly humbled for them.</note> their great ſinnings, and then God did ſhew them mercy in the pardon of thoſe ſins. Zach. 12. 11. In that day there ſhall be <hi>a great mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo.</hi> Chap. 13. 1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a Fountain opened to the houſe of David, and to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Jeruſalem for ſinne, and for uncleanneſſe.</hi> Jer. 31. 19. <hi>I was aſhamed, yea even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Pſal. 6. 6. <hi>I am weary of my groaning, all the night I make my bed to ſwim, I water my Couch with my tears.</hi> and (you know the Lord forgave his great ſins.) Luk. 7. 38. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>

                        <hi>ſtood at the feet of Chriſt behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with tears.</hi> Ver. 48. <hi>And he ſaid unto her, Thy ſinnes are forgiven thee. Peter went out and wept bitterly for his great ſin,</hi> and that ſin was forgiven. And <hi>Paul</hi> fell down and trembled for his great ſins, and they were pardoned. In all theſe inſtances you ſee great mourning for great ſins, and gracious pardon for them; Go you and doe likewiſe, and you ſhall find friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That they have <hi>cordially and really forſaken their great ſinnes;</hi> they durſt not continue in them, but have loathed themſelves and their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">Cordially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them.</note> and have caſt them away: Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a 9. 14. <hi>Should we again break thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and joyn with the people of theſe abominations?</hi> Iſa. 30. 22. <hi>Ye ſhall alſo defile the covering of thy graven Images of ſilver, and the ornaments of thy molten images of gold, then ſhalt thou caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth; thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence!</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>Then ſhall he give the rain of thy ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſ. 14. 8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more with Idols? I have heard him and conſidered him. I am like a green firre tree, from me is thy fruit found.</hi> Judg. 10. 16. <hi>And they put away the ſtrange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord.</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>Repent and be converted that your ſinnes may be blotted out.</hi> Thus did <hi>David,</hi> thus did <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> thus did <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Prodigal, and thereupon did find mercy: <hi>Such were ſome of you,</hi> but ye are <hi>ſanctified,</hi> but <hi>ye are juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> Lookſt thou for mercy to pardon great ſins, and yet ſtill goeſt on in thy treſpaſſes! &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That they have earneſtly prayed unto the Lord for the forgiveneſſe of their</hi>

                        <hi>great ſinnes:</hi> Exod. 32. 31. <hi>O this people have ſinned a great ſinne, and have made themſelves gods of gold.</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>Yet now if thou wilt forgive their ſinne; and if not, blot me I pray thee out of the book which thou haſt written;</hi> ſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> prayed. Pſal. 25. 11. <hi>For thy Names ſake O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</hi> Dan. 9. 5. <hi>We have ſinned and committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled by departing from thy precepts.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>To the Lord our God belong mercies, and forgiveneſſe, though we have rebelled againſt him.</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>O Lord hear; O Lord forgive! O Lord hearken and deferre not for thy Name ſake.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>We do not preſent our ſupplications unto thee for our righteouſneſſe, but for thy great mercies.</hi> Luke 18. 13. <hi>And the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſtood a farre off, and would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be mercifull unto me a ſinner.</hi> In theſe Prayers for the pardon of great ſinnes, you may eſpy four Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>That they have pleaded with God upon ſuch grounds which have alwayes</hi>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>They have patiently waited upon the Lord, untill that he hath ſhewed them</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, Having ſhewed unto you what courſe is to be taken for to get the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <note place="margin">Evidences of the pardon of great ſins.</note> of great tranſgreſſions, I ſhall now deliver unto you ſome <hi>ſigns or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> by which one may certainly know that God hath forgiven his great ſins.</p>
                     <p>There are ſix Evidences of this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There always goes <hi>a great change with the forgiveneſs of great ſins;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A great change accompanying it.</note> It is a great queſtion whether Juſtification be before Sanctification; whatſoever may be diſputed for the priority of nature, yet it is agreed there is no priority of time; for as ſoon as any ſinner is juſtified and pardoned, he is changed and ſanctified the <hi>blood</hi> and the <hi>water</hi> go together; as ſoon as any one is in Chriſt, he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and there <hi>is no condemnation unto him,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. And ſo as ſoon as any is in Chriſt, he <hi>is a new creature; old things are paſt away, and all things become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 15. 17. What an unclean perſon was <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> before ſhe was called to Chriſt, and found mercy? and after mercy was obtained, what an eminent Chriſtian was ſhe? what a violent and injurious Perſecutor was <hi>Paul</hi> in times paſt? and <hi>when he obtained mercy,</hi> what an admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Chriſtian was he? Of all the changes incident to ſinners, the greateſt change appears in the greateſt ſinner received to mercy and forgiveneſs; there are two conſpicuous changes in them.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The greateſt inward change;</hi> the ſins which he formerly loved more than his ſoul, he now doth hate more than hell; (he once out faced the Word, and now trembles at it.)</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>The greateſt outward change;</hi> the worſt ſinner (being received to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) proves the choiceſt Chriſtian; he is now as notable in a gracious walking, as he was (once) notorious in a licentious living, exemplary in both reſpects, and in both wayes and courſes.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>An helping compaſſion,</hi> eſpecially to thoſe unto whom he hath been the occaſion or cauſe of great ſins, even pulling them out of the fire, weeping, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, <hi>inſtructing them with meekneſs, if peradventure God will give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. David</hi> after the pardon of his great ſins, then ſaith he, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 51. 13.) <hi>will I teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A forgiving compaſſion;</hi> bearing much, and forgiving much, as God for Chriſt ſake hath forgiven them.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>True peace and joy,</hi> which flow only from forgiving mercy. <hi>Luke</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">True peace and joy.</note> 7. 48. <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven.</hi> Ver. 50. <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace.</hi> Rom. 5. 11. <hi>We alſo joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the atonement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold peace in a ſinner.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One ariſeth from <hi>ſtupidity,</hi> and depends upon an ignorant and ſeared conſcience, as a ſick man is quiet while he ſleeps.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another ariſeth from <hi>faith,</hi> which ſeals to the goodneſs and truth of the promiſe, and cauſeth the ſoul to reſt in that good and faithful Word, that God for Chriſts ſake will indeed forgive their great ſins; a peace that follows faith, is a right peace, and a right teſtimony that ſin is forgiven. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 21. <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi>
                     </p>

1. Conſider the great ſinners <hi>whom God hath pardoned,</hi> as they were great ſinners, ſo they were great penitents. <hi>David</hi> was guilty of great ſins, but he repented of them all; he repented of his murder, and he repented of his adultery, and he repented of his pride in numbring the people. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was an exceeding great ſinner (hardly any the like, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to <hi>ver.</hi> 11.) but he repented of his great ſins; <hi>he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers,</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>And pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, and he was intreated of him,</hi> Ver. 13. And he reformed all again; for he pulled down, and <hi>put away all his Idolatry,</hi> Ver. 15. And he did ſet up the true worſhip of God again, and commanded <hi>Judah to ſerve the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> Ver. 16; &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider the great ſinners <hi>whom God doth promiſe to pardon,</hi> certainly you ſhall find that promiſe to paſs upon terms of repentance; not elſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Come now, let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together ſaith the Lord; Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out;</hi> what their great ſins were, you may read in <hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>God hath threatned unto great ſinners</hi> (on whom his mercy hath <note place="margin">God threatens eternal wrath to them that repent not.</note> not wrought repentance) <hi>eternal wrath, and a peremptory privation of mercy,</hi> with inevitable deſtruction unto them who have preſumed to go on in their ſins; for the firſt of theſe, ſee the known place of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>But after thy hardneſs, and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up to thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God:</hi> For the latter of theſe, ſee that ſmart place in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. <hi>And it come to paſs, when he heareth the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>A going on ſtill in great ſins, if it be any ſure testimony at all, it is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Perſiſting in great ſins, if any teſtimony at all, it is rather that God will not pardon.</note> 
                        <hi>rather that God will never forgive you, than otherwiſe;</hi> why ſo, will you ſay? becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no promiſe of mercy to any that goes on in his great tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but refuſeth to hearken, and to return; in ſuch a condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. There are dreadful threatnings of God againſt ſuch who ſhall go ſtill on in their treſpaſſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 21. <hi>And God ſhall wound the head of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one as goes on ſtill in his trespaſſes.</hi> Iſa. 65. 20. <hi>The ſinner being an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed.</hi> Prov. 29. 1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Your going on ſtill in ſinning (unleſs the Lord be infinitely and extraordinary merciful towards you) will render you utterly uncapable of forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy; for</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This courſe of ſinning is that which doth deſperately harden your hearts, and fear your conſciences, that no dealing whatſoever can make
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:55323:240"/>
any impreſſion upon you toward Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Lord doth uſually give up ſuch ſinners to their own hearts luſts, and to a reprobate mind and ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Though (poſſibly) ſome few ſinners (who have for a long time continued <note place="margin">Though a few ſuch obtain mercy, yet they are hardly perſwaded of Gods mercy.</note> in great tranſgreſſions) may obtain mercy, yet <hi>they ſhall find it a very difficult work to be perſwaded of Gods mercy to their ſouls.</hi> Pſal. 6. 3. <hi>My ſoul is alſo ſore vexed, but O Lord how long?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>the threatnings of God are ſo many, and ſo expreſs</hi> againſt great ſins, (eſpecially againſt the continuing in them) that it will not be eaſie to over-ballance theſe threatnings of God with the promiſe of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>the truth of repentance is very apt to be much queſtioned by great ſinners,</hi> when yet indeed they do repent; they do conceive (and that rightly) that for extraordinary ſinnings, extraordinary repentance is required; but they feel ſuch a hardneſs, ſuch a deadneſs of heart, O they cannot repent! And let me tell you, if any great ſinner be in diſpute about the truth of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he will alſo be in diſpute about the apprehenſion of mercy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>of all ſins whatſoever, great ſins do incline us</hi> (under the clear apprehenſion of them) <hi>to deſpair:</hi> You ſhall find this experimentally true, that the more deſperate people have been in ſinning, they are more apt to deſpair, when conſcience ever ſets upon them for their ſins. The guilt of great ſins will be heavy and bitter, and the woundings for great ſins will be ſharp and deep; always (for them) there falls in the ſenſe of Gods great wrath, and the fear of Gods great judgement, and the inſtances of the great puniſhments of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on great tranſgreſſions; and with all theſe, Satans great and ſubtile tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, all which are powerfully apt to ſink the ſinner with deſpair; and then this is clear, that the more apt any ſinner is to deſpair, the leſs apt is the ſinner to cloſe with pardoning mercy; nay, it falls off the more from the hope of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe <hi>the Lord is pleaſed to hold up the manifeſtation of his love a long time, from thoſe that have a long time ſinned againſt the offers and calls of his love and mercy;</hi> thereby teaching great ſinners how unworthy they are to taſte of his goodneſs, and warning other great ſinners not to preſume of any eaſie enjoyment of mercy. And you ſhall find it a hard work to ſettle and perſwade the conſcience of a great ſinner about mercy, when the Lord doth (after many ſeekings) ſtill hold up the manifeſtations or ſenſible expreſſions of his favour and mercy towards him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe <hi>it is a very difficult thing to act faith under the ſenſe of great tranſgreſſions;</hi> leſſer iniquities do many times check and keep down our confidences, much mort do great tranſgreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What that troubled ſinner ſhould do who hath been guilty of ſome great ſin, for which he cannot finde any one parallel inſtance of forgiveneſs in all the Scriptures,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>that ever God did forgive any that were guilty of that ſinne.</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this very ſadly diſtreſſing Caſe, I would deliver theſe ſix Anſwers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is true, that <hi>a perſon convinced of, and really troubled with the ſenſe of any great ſin, doth look after, and will not eaſily be ſatisfied in conſcience</hi>
                        <pb n="452" facs="tcp:55323:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>without a parallel inſtance</hi> in the Scripture of ſome ſinners in the like conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of guilt with himſelf, whom yet God did pardon; but did ever any ſin as I have ſinned? and did God ever pardon any who have ſinned as I have ſinned? or had their ſin all thoſe aggravations (though God hath pardoned them) as my ſin hath? can you give me any one clear record or pattern of the ſame?</p>
                     <p>There are two reaſons which draw a troubled ſinner thus to ſearch, and thus to enquire.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is, becauſe he thinks that what God never did in a way of mercy, he will never do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, becauſe he thinks that the apprehenſion of great mercy paſt in a caſe parallel with his, will be a quicker help to his hope and faith, that God may likewiſe forgive his great ſins, even as he hath forgiven the ſame to others.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs (under favour be it ſpoken) <hi>this is not ſo regular a way,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Yet this is not ſo regular, nor ſo ſure a ground of hope.</note> 
                        <hi>nor yet ſo ſure a ground for hopes of mercy;</hi> for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If inſtances and precedent patterns of former mercy were neceſſarily to be look't at as grounds for hopes in us of the like mercy, then the firſt tranſgreſſors, they that had been firſt in the guilt of great tranſgreſſions muſt have deſpaired of forgiveneſs; for no pattern, example or inſtance of the like was ever found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but mercy was pleaſed to make them the pattern of mercy for others; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Howbeit for this cauſe I obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that in me firſt, Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to them which ſhould hereafter believe on him to life everlaſting.</hi> The Lord himſelf would have put us upon that way of ſearching records and inſtances, before we ſhould look up unto thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such high Idolatries, ſacrificing of Children to the Divels. Yet this greateſt of ſinners that you read of in the old Teſtament, upon his deep repentance found mercy; as <hi>Paul</hi> who called himſelf the <hi>chiefeſt of ſinners</hi> in the New Teſtament, did likewiſe obtain mercy, &amp;c.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Under the ſenſe of great ſinnings, the buſineſſe is not to debate, but to repent.</note>

                     <p>You demand what a great ſinner ſhould do, who can find no inſtance of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to any under the ſame guilt with himſelf! I anſwer plainly;</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>Sixthly, And let me tell you one thing more; That as when God forbids any kind of ſin, he doth therein forbid the particular individual branches of that ſin: So (if I do not exceedingly miſtake) when he doth promiſe to forgive a ſin in any kind, that promiſe of forgiveneſs will extend to any one particular or diſtinct ſin of that kind; be that particular ſin never ſo hainous, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Truely I think that whatſoever we may (Theoretically) argue in ſuch a caſe, yet (practically) he that is wounded in Conſcience for any great ſin, hath little leaſure or ability to keep Rank or File; I mean thus artificially to conſider the Method or Order of Spiritual actings: But one while he thinks on ſin, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while on mercy; when on his ſin, then with great fears; and when on mercy, then with great doubts. That he ſhould repent, he knows; that he may preſently believe, he queſtions; and to ſpeak plainly, he can neither well repent, nor yet well believe; a third work ordinarily preſſeth him, which is of a troubled; and troubling Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But yet if you would have me ſpeak my thought to this Nicity, rather than Caſe of Conſcience, I ſhould ſay,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As to experience; trouble and tears, and fears, and ſighes, and groanes are (uſually) the immediate workings and iſſues of great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to the command; Repentance is the firſt work which God layes out for the great ſinner; This generally you read preſcribed both in the Old and New Teſtament, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19. And truely it will be no eaſie work to clear out, that a man can or may believe, that God (according to promiſe) will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his ſins (though very great) whiles he yet remaines impenitent.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As to the order of practice; I would preſcribe both of them to be firſt; The ſinner ſhould repent firſt, and the ſinner ſhould believe firſt; and that he may do both firſt, he ſhould pray for both firſt. A believing Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a Repenting Faith; ſuch a Repentance which is accompanied with Faith; and ſuch a Faith as accompanied with Repentance: And verily in this caſe, if the Faith be right, it is not without Repentance; and if the Repentance be right, it is not without Faith: you cannot rightly repent unleſs you have Faith to ſee ſome mercy; neither can you confidently believe unleſs there be ſome Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I beſeech you whiles others are a diſputing which of theſe ſhould appear firſt, do you earneſtly and ſeriouſly beg of God for grace to act them both.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this it may be anſwered, that it doth ariſe from</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>dignity of the perſon of Chriſt</hi> who was God-man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Concurrence of both the natures of Chriſt,</hi> in all his Mediatory actions and paſſions, ſo that they were Theandrical, ſufferings both Humane and Divine; and therefore his blood is called <hi>the blood of God,</hi> (Acts 20. 28. <hi>God purchaſed the Church with his own blood.)</hi> and the <hi>Lord of glory</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be crucified, (they crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8.) And from theſe two Conſiderations there is light enough to convince us of the wonderful power and vertue in the blood of Chriſt to reach the forgiveneſs of all our ſins, becauſe he was an infinite perſon, and for him to ſuffer and dye, was more than if all the ſons of men had done ſo. And becauſe the vertue of his Deity did ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, and attend his Death or Sacrifice, that thereupon it came to be of more than ſufficient worth to ſatisfie Gods juſtice, and to expiate our ſins; for although there was in our ſins an abounding meaſure of guilt, yet there was in the blood of Chriſt (it being the obedience of one who was God) a ſuperabounding worth to weigh down and remove all the malignity and demerit in the ſin of man; there being no more proportion 'twixt the demerit of our ſinnings, and the demerit of his ſufferings, than there is 'twixt our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and his perſon.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It was neceſſary that the blood of Chriſt ſhould be ſhed to waſh us from our ſins, becauſe</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Divine juſtice muſt be ſatisfied</hi> before ſins can be forgiven; till that <note place="margin">Divine juſtice muſt be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> be done, mercy it ſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) is not at liberty; therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us that <hi>God did ſet forth Christ to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> (Rom. 3. 25.) <hi>To declare his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus,</hi> (Ver. 26.) The meaning is, that the blood of Chriſt reconciled both theſe Attributes of God; juſtice calls for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; there it is ſaith Chriſt, my blood hath ſatisfied you; and mercy longs to help and pardon the poor ſinner; it ſhall come ſaith Chriſt, for my blood hath purchaſed it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Jeſus Christ muſt make good his bargain and agreement;</hi> he did agree with <note place="margin">Chriſt muſt make good his bargain.</note> his Father to be a Surety for all his people, and was content to ſtand in their ſtead, and to have all their iniquities laid upon himſelf, and to anſwer for them, and to ſuffer for them, and to clear and diſcharge them, and to reconcile and ſave them by his death; and therefore even upon that account it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould dye, and ſhed his blood, that the agreement 'twixt him and the Father might be performed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, We are <hi>juſtified by his blood, and ſaved from wrath.</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Much more being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath by him.</hi> Pray, tell me what is it to be juſtified, but to be pardoned? and what is it to be ſaved from wrath, but to be delivered from all puniſhment? and both theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the blood of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Now I come to the ſecond Branch of the Aſſertion, that as Jeſus <note place="margin">Chriſts blood the only cauſe of pardon;</note> Chriſts blood is the cauſe, ſo it <hi>is the only cauſe for which God forgives the ſins of his people.</hi>

                     <p>There are five glaſſes in which we may behold the hideous guilt of our ſins, of which yet many perſons do but yet make a work of paſtime.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is the <hi>dreadful threatnings of the Law of God,</hi> which reveals and diſcharges the wrath of God, and all ſorts of curſes, corporal, and ſpiritual, and eternal againſt people for their ſins.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, That <hi>no creature,</hi> no not all the creatures in heaven and earth <hi>could pacifie God,</hi> and cleanſe us from our ſins, and procure the pardon of them, <hi>but Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God alone: Neither Angels nor Saints, nor righteouſneſs, nor prayers nor gold, nor ſilver can give unto God a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="462" facs="tcp:55323:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, As none can procure the pardon of ſin but Chriſt, ſo <hi>Chriſt could not do it, but by dying;</hi> indeed there was very much excellency and worth in the active obedience of Chriſt, in the holineſs of his life, and exactneſs of his works; nevertheleſs to get off our ſins, his paſſive obedience is likewiſe required, without that there was no remidion: <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood,</hi> Rev. 5. 9.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As Chriſt muſt dye to get the pardon of ſin, ſo every death of Chriſt is not ſufficient, but he muſt <hi>dye that accurſed death of the Croſs,</hi> and become a curſe for us, or elſe he could not have got the pardon of our ſins; hear the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us; for it is written, curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree.</hi> Coloſ. 1. 20. <hi>He made peace through the blood of his Croſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Neither would this have ſufficed to dye on the Croſs, (there enduring the grievous torments in his ſoul and body due to our ſins) <hi>if he had not been God as well as man.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 16. ſpeaking of the perſon of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>God laid down his life for us;</hi> and indeed that muſt be of infinite price and merit, which muſt anſwer the everlaſting torments due for all the ſins of all the Elect; there had not been enough in the death of Chriſt, had it not been the death of a perſon who was God as well as Man. Thus you ſee (even in the blood of Chriſt) the hainouſneſs of ſin, and the high guilt thereof, which may make us to fear and tremble at the conſideration of our own exceeding guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>To look after Chriſt in another manner than formerly we have done:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">To look after Chriſt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than formerly.</note> Why, will you ſay? becauſe in his blood only we have the remiſſion of ſins, that it is the only cauſe for which God doth forgive us.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe this is the principal Uſe which (I think) can be made of this point, I will therefore briefly ſpeak unto theſe three queſtions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I do but occaſionally move this queſtion for their ſakes who would fain be aſcertained that their ſins are forgiven, of which they cannot be, unleſs and untill they be aſcertained of Chriſt; but to the Quaeries, one may know that he hath got Chriſt, that Chriſt is his, and he is Chriſts, by three Characters, expreſſed in <note place="margin">Three Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of it.</note> three places of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. A new creature is changed, his mind new, and judgement new, and affections new, and words and converſation new, and company new, and employment new, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. No ſin hath dominion, every ſin is crucified, it hath loſt its dominion; we are no friends to ſin, no ſervants to ſin; as Chriſt dyed for our ſins, ſo they that are Chriſts, dye unto their ſins, in reſpect of love, and of action.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt becomes the Author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Hebr. 5. 9. Chriſt rules where Chriſt ſaves; if he be thy Lord, aſſuredly he is thy Saviour: <hi>His we are, whoſe ſervants we are, whom we do obey. Thou haſt delivered us, and therefore thou ſhalt reign over us,</hi> ſaid they to <hi>Gideon;</hi> ſo the man who is in Chriſt, Thou haſt redeemed me by thy blood, and therefore thou ſhalt rule me by thy Spirit; but if we will not obey Chriſt, we have no intereſt in him.</p>

But moreover</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt for forgiveneſs, it is <hi>a noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beſides this, there is given unto every one of the people of God an <note place="margin">By a renewed Conſcience.</note> 
                        <hi>illightned and renewed conſcience</hi> which knows the preſent frame of heart, and can give in a clear teſtimony concerning it, whether it doth indeed Repent, and indeed believe (finding it ſuch as the word requires) from whence it can make a concluding evidence that our ſinnes are certainly pardoned; for thus conſcience reaſoneth: Whoſoever doth truely repent and believe, God himſelf in his Word ſaith, that his ſins are forgiven: But (ſaith the enlightned and renewed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which knows what is in man) thou doſt truly repent and believe, for I find ſuch lively acts and effects of them both, which the Word of God gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them in truth; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Be of good comfort and rejoyce; thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</p>

                     <p>There are three things which may convince you of that.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. Another <hi>is the giving of the Spirit of God unto you,</hi> and that for this very end, to make <hi>known unto you the things which he hath prepared for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. and which <hi>he hath freely given unto you,</hi> Ver. 12. and to <hi>ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his love in your hearts,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. and to <hi>ſeal</hi> or <hi>aſſure you,</hi> Epheſ 1. 13.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſeveral experimental attainments</hi> of the people of God in this one particular. <hi>David</hi> gained this aſſurance of the pardon of his ſins, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.

                     <p>Fifthly, This is it which would <hi>bear up your hearts</hi> in all the ſad days which do or may befall you. If you be ſick, this would be better than health; what a cordial did Chriſt deliver to the diſeaſed man in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee!</hi> If you be perſecuted and troubled, this would be a triumphant ſecurity unto you. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation? or diſtreſs? or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution? or famine? or nakedneſs? op peril? or ſword?</hi> Ver. 37 <hi>Nay, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us.</hi> Rom. 5: 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>And we glory in tribulation.</hi> I confeſs that faith can make a man to ſubmit in a croſs, but aſſurance will make a Chriſtian to triumph on it and over it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, What ſhall I ſay more? this aſſurance would <hi>make your whole life a delightful Paradiſe, and your death</hi> (at the laſt) <hi>a deſirable and quiet harbour and paſſage.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. <hi>For we know that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> If your ſins for Chriſts ſake be pardoned, and you are aſſured thereof by the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, then unqueſtionably there is no condemnation unto you, and then as unqueſtionably your ſouls ſhall be ſaved, and everlaſtingly bleſſed; for Juſtification doth infallibly end in Glorification, &amp;c.</p>

I <note place="margin">It is poſſible to be deceived.</note> do not know any one thing in reference to ſalvation, but it is poſſible for ſome or other to be deceived in or about it.

true Religion. It is poſſible for a man to pleaſe himſelf with falſe graces inſtead of true graces; and with falſe repentance inſtead of true; and with falſe faith inſtead of true; and with falſe love inſtead of true; and with a falſe perſwaſion or aſſurance inſtead of a true perſwaſion and aſſurance.

Error is a natural to the corrupt judgement of man as any other ſin; and heart-deceitfulneſs is as proper unto us as heart-ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Doth not the <hi>Prince of darkneſs</hi> often change himſelf into <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light?</hi> And as he deludes men about the ſtate of grace, ſo he can as eaſily delude them about the comforts of that eſtate: Why is it not as probable that Satan may render a bad eſtate as good, and ſo cheat us with joy, as he doth ſometimes render a good eſtate as bad, and ſo oppreſs us with fear and grief?</p>
                     <p>Nay once more, Men will ſet up ſuch opinions as do eaſily lead them into a falſe aſſurance; <hi>v. g.</hi>

                     </list>
                     <p>Secondly, As it is poſſible, ſo it is <hi>real; Many have deceived themſelves</hi> with a falſe aſſurance inſtead of a true. The <hi>Jews</hi> did ſo, who called God <note place="margin">Many have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> their God, and their Father, and inſiſted upon it with Chriſt that ſo it was, and that they were his children and free-men. So did <hi>Laodicea</hi> cheat and delude her ſelf with a falſe perſwaſion, that <hi>ſhe was rich, and increaſed, and ſtood in need of nothing,</hi> Revel 3. Nay the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> he himſelf was thus delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>I</hi> ſaith he <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>9.) <hi>was alive once without the Law:</hi> (2 Cor. 10. 7. <hi>If any man truſt to himſelf that he is Chriſts, &amp;c.)</hi> Did not they deceive themſelves with a falſe perſwaſion, who call upon Chriſt <hi>to open the door of heaven unto them, Lord, Lord, open unto us?</hi> Matth. 25 11. And they alſo who plead with Chriſt, and conteſt with him, <hi>Have we not heard thee preach in our Synagogues? Have we not eat and drunk in thy preſence,</hi> &amp;c? Luke 13. 26. There is not any one hypocrite, there is not any one formal Profeſſor, but he doth deceive himſelf with a falſe opinion of his eſtate, and with a falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
                     <p>And there are four great Reaſons why theſe men do thus delude themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is <hi>Pride of heart</hi> and vain-glory; they will appear not to be inferiour to any, and therefore will deceive themſelves to deceive others, and will boaſt of what they have not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is the <hi>reach of common gifts,</hi> which may give them a <hi>taste of Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>good Word, and of the Powers of the world to come,</hi> Hebr. 6. 5. A taſte makes them think it is aſſurance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third is the <hi>neglect of ſelf-examination;</hi> they take things upon truſt, and will not ſearch their hearts, and try their ways, and bring them to the light, to the rule, to the touch-ſtone, to the Word; they will not try their hearts by the Word, nor their ſuppoſed graces by the Word, nor their comforts nor aſſurances by the Word, and therefore they deceive themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fourth is the <hi>juſt iudgement of God upon them,</hi> to ſend them <hi>ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye, becauſe they received not the love of the ruth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11. Only a notion of it, but not the love of it; only the form, but not the power of godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="475" facs="tcp:55323:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thirdly, As many have deceived themſelves with a falſe aſſurance, <hi>ſo</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Many ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. How one may know he hath a falſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> 
                        <hi>many ſtill do deceive themſelves</hi> with a falſe aſſurance inſtead of a true aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But will ſome of you ſay, that is the queſtion unto which we deſire you to ſpeak a few words, what are the diſcoveries of a falſe aſſurance? or how one may know that the aſſurance or perſwaſion which he hath if the forgiveneſs of his ſins is falſe, is but a deluſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> For your help in this, I will preſent unto you ſix infallible diſcoveries of a falſe aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The firſt is, <hi>When it is a ſeal without any date;</hi> my meaning is, when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">When it is a ſeal without a date.</note> always hath had aſſurance, never was there any time when he doubted of this point, he was never troubled concerning it, but always believed, and his heart hath always been confidently perſwaded that Chriſt dyed for him, and that his ſins were pardoned. Why, this alone may convince thee that thy aſſurance is but a deluſion: Mark the Apoſtle a little in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, Father.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.</hi> Here the Apoſtle lays out three works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with the order of his workings.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, He is <hi>(efficientè &amp; operativè)</hi> the ſpirit of bondage to fear; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> making us rightly ſenſible of our ſinful and miſerable condition, which makes our hearts to fear what the Lord will do againſt us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, Hereupon (in time) he is the Spirit of Adoption, working faith in us, by which we become the children of God, and look on him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with love, and without any ſervile fear.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, After both theſe, he is the Spirit of aſſurance, bearing witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the children of God. This is the laſt work of the Spirit, it is not the firſt, nor the only work of the Spirit; it comes after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, as that comes after the ſpirit of bondage to fear. From this place thou mayſt evidently diſcern the aſſurance (of which thou boaſteſt) to be falſe, to be no work of the Spirit, who begins in a work of conviction and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and ends in a work of teſtimony and aſſurance; begins in bondage, and ends in liberty; begins in fear, and ends in peace and comfort; the Spirit never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, but ends in comfort.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond diſcovery of a falſe aſſurance is this, that <hi>as it hath</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It hath not the Spirit of God for the Author of it.</note> 
                        <hi>not the Spirit of God for the Author of it,</hi> ſo it hath not the Word of God for the Inſtrument and means of it. Beloved, the Word of God is the Organ or Inſtrument which the Spirit of God doth (ordinarily) uſe for the forming of all his gifts and graces, and comforts upon the ſoul of man; I hardly know any one of them for which he doth not employ the Miniſtry of the Word; when the Spirit</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Enlightens the ſoul;</hi> he makes uſe of the Word to convey and let in light into the ſoul. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. <hi>It enlightens the eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Humbles the heart;</hi> he makes uſe of the Word to break the heart, and to lay it low. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>When they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Converts</hi> and calls the ſoul; he calls it by the Word, and converts it by the Word, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>He called you by our Goſpel,</hi> Jam. 1. 18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Brings in a ſoul by faith</hi> unto Chriſt, he doth this by the Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.</p>

                        </gap> aſſures it by the Word, yea, and recovers by the Word aſſurance when it is loſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom we alſo trusted, after that</hi>
                        <pb n="476" facs="tcp:55323:253"/>
                        <hi>ye heard the Word of truth, the Goſpel of ſalvation; In whom after that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe.</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 5. <hi>Our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel came unto you, not in word only, but power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> Here you ſee the Word to be the means of believing, and ſo making way for ſealing and aſſuring. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 50. <hi>Thy Word hath quickned me;</hi> but now a falſe aſſurance was never wrought by the Word; which will appear plainly, if you do conſider three things that are uſually found in men preſumptuouſly and deludingly aſſured.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They care little for the Word,</hi> eſpecially for that Word of God which doth powerfully ſearch and prepare the heart, and fit it for the aſſuring work of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They have moſt peace and aſſurance, when they keep them moſt from the faithful and powerful delivery of the Word;</hi> and their aſſurance is never more interrupted and ſhaken, and daſhed, than under the ſoul ſearching, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Miniſtry of the Goſpel; it cannot ſtand before it, nor abide the tryal of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding <hi>all their ſeeming regards unto the Word,</hi> yet never is there <hi>any thing contributed by the Word unto their aſſurance,</hi> nor further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming or ſtrengthening, or enlarging; all which doth evidently demonſtrate, that a falſe aſſurance was never wrought by the Word, but is the fruit of fancy, and a dream of our own hearts only.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A further diſcovery of a falſe aſſurance, is this, <hi>it is enjoyed at an</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is enjoyed at an eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>eaſie rate;</hi> the price of it is very cheap; as that ill piece of ground <hi>preſently received the Word with joy,</hi> Luke 8. 13. ſo a falſe aſſurance riſeth very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: This houre very wicked, and the next ſtrangely aſſured, it coſt the man no tears, nor prayers, nor wreſtlings; for a man to be much in ignorance and wickedneſs, and much in joy and aſſurance, this cannot be right; for the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. would have us <hi>give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure;</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>To work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling:</hi> All diligence, and much pains muſt be laid out to attain a true aſſurance. <hi>Many prayers:</hi> Pſal. 51. 8. <hi>Make me to hear joy and gladneſs. Many tears:</hi> Pſal. 6. 6. <hi>All the night make I my bed to ſwim, I water my couch with my tears. Many waitings:</hi> Pſal. 85. 2. <hi>I will hearken what God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A falſe aſſurance, is <hi>a poſſeſſion without a title:</hi> The man talks of <note place="margin">It is a poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without a title.</note> much joy and peace, and comfort, and aſſurance; but there is not any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, of theſe things to him; nay, God is ſo far from promiſing aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of forgiveneſs, that (in the condition wherein this perſon remains) there is not any one promiſe of forgiveneſs; for he is wicked and unconverted, and a ſtranger to Chriſt; and to one remaining ſo, there is not ſo much as a promiſe of pardon, much leſs a promiſe of aſſurance that ſin is pardoned. Now take this for a certain truth, that the aſſurance which any man hath of the pardon of his ſins, if it hath no foundation in a promiſe, it is but a falſe deluſion; if God hath not promiſed to forgive you, you cannot be ſafely aſſured that you are forgiven; much more is it falſe, if God threatens to deſtroy you for your unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency. Suppoſe one doth promiſe and enſure (in a conveyance of land) ſuch or ſuch an eſtate, to ſuch or ſuch a perſon, whoſe name is there inſerted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, Will you, or may you thereupon ſeize your ſelf of that eſtate, and think to make money of it as yours, who are not named in it? this were a ridiculous mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Fifthly, A falſe aſſurance, it is either <hi>without all ground, or without all</hi>

The man cannot (if he will ſpeak the truth) give you any reaſon at all; but ſo he thinks, and he is of that mind, and will be ſo; and if he doth give you arguments and grounds, they are of ſuch a vulgar and common nature, as no ſolid Chriſtian dare build on them, and the Scripture rejects them as unſafe, being (at the beſt and higheſt) no other than civil men or hypocrites may be poſſeſſed of; perhaps ſome outward temporal proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; perhaps ſome works of civil righteouſneſs; perhaps ſome common ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural gifts; perhaps ſome external religious performances; perhaps ſome ſudden tranſient affections; theſe, or ſome other common works of the Spirit (or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters below theſe) are the foundations and bottomes upon which all his aſſurance is built. <label type="milestone">

This is ſoul deceit, and moſt woful deceit;
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:55323:254"/>
it is worſe than to reſt upon a falſe title for all our worldly eſtate; it is worſe than to truſt to a falſe plea, and vain defence for a mans life; and it is the worſe becauſe</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The ſinner will not eaſily be convinced.</item>
                        <item>2. Nor come back, and begin the work aright, in a contrary grief and ſorrow for his miſtake.</item>
                        <item>3. Nor be ſhamed of his own fooliſhneſs.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Secondly, It is <hi>ſoul loſs:</hi> unleſs the Lord break down this falſe aſſurance <note place="margin">It is ſoul loſs.</note> in our hearts, it will end in the eternal loſs of our ſouls. I told you the laſt day, that that mans condition is more hopeful, whoſe conſcience is filled with terror for his ſins, than his condition is, whoſe heart is filled with a falſe perſwaſion and aſſurance that his ſins are pardoned; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake to the ſelf-conceited Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees; <hi>Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdome of God before you,</hi> Matth. 21. 31. Or as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake, <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool, than of him,</hi> Prov. 26. 12. So ſay I, there is more hope of the ſalvation of the moſt doubting, and moſt terribly dejected and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſinner, than of the confident and (falſly) aſſured ſinner; why ſo will you ſay? my reaſon is this, becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When a perſon is in a troubled condition, he is rightly ſenſible of his condition, he ſees that it is ill with him; but the falſly aſſured ſinner doth not ſee in what an evil condition he is, and certainly it is a worſe matter to be in an evil condition, and not apprehend it, than to be in that evil condition, and yet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When a perſon ſees himſelf in an evil condition, there may be, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there are fears to remain in it, and cares to get out of it: <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> ſpake thoſe wounded in their hearts for their ſins. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. And the <hi>Jaylor came in trembling, and cryed out, What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16. 30. But when a perſon hath deluded himſelf with a falſe confidence that his eſtate is good, and with a falſe aſſurance that his ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and God is reconciled unto him; this man is whole, he minds not the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, looks not after Chriſt and mercy, and ſo loſeth his ſoul. Beloved, this is certain, that falſe aſſurance breeds carnal ſecurity, and carnal ſecurity breeds ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Chriſt, and neglect of Chriſt breeds loſs of mercy, and loſs of mercy will be the loſs of the ſoul. <note place="margin">It is ſoul diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is ſoul-failure and diſappointment;</hi> what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 19. <hi>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</hi> He is of no uſe or ſervice unto you, that ſay I of a falſe aſſurance, when you come to a time of need, and then expect help from your falſe aſſurance, and deluded confidence, then you will finde that it will be of no more ſtrength and ſervice to you, than a foot out of joint, it will utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail you, and deceive you. When the winds and the waves aroſe, then the houſe built on the ſand did fall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 26, 27. So when death comes, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is awakened, and ariſeth in exceptions and accuſations, and chargeth guilt (as unpardoned) upon the ſoul, in that day what will become of all your vain confidences? and of all your fooliſh and falſe excuſations? they will be ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as the Spiders web, and like a dream they preſently vaniſh into nothing. Now from all that hath been ſaid, you do ſee great reaſon as to ſtrive for a right aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo to take heed, and beware of a falſe perſwaſion and aſſurance that your ſins are pardoned.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, There alwayes goes <hi>an humbling and mourning heart</hi> before a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived heart about the pardon of our ſins: <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Humbling and mourning.</note> 
                        <hi>upon me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance unto the captive.</hi> And Iſa. 61. 2. <hi>To comfort all that mourn.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>To give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oyle of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the spirit of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> Mark, here are broken-hearted ſinners, and theſe doth the Spirit heal; and here are captivated ſinners, and theſe doth the Spirit deliver and free; and here are mourning ſinners, and theſe doth the Spirit comfort: Why, it is not reaſonable to imagine that the Spirit of God will do any thing which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, or improper, or repugnant to his own Word; but all his works within us are pertinent, and are conſonant with the Word.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are <hi>pertinent;</hi> he will comfort thoſe to whom comfort pertains.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are <hi>proper;</hi> he will comfort them that need comfort, and in the times of their need.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are <hi>conſonant;</hi> he will apply comfort to them unto whom God promiſeth comfort. Now comfort pertains to the broken-hearted, and unto mourners for ſin; and it is proper for them, they ſtand in need of the voice of joy and gladneſs; and God hath (in a ſpecial manner) promiſed to comfort them that mourn. Therefore if the aſſurance (which you find) of the pardon of your ſins be a gracious peace and quietation, and perſwaſion after conviction, and after godly ſorrow for your ſins, this is no feigned nor deluding work of fancy, nor of Satan; but it is the very voice of joy from the Spirit of God. O when a poor troubled ſoul hath been laid low in the ſenſe of ſin, hath gone heavily all

the day with that burden, is even confounded and aſhamed, and is ready to fail and faint, and cryes out, O Lord, pity and pardon, and comfort my diſtreſſed ſoul with the aſſurance of thy love, and of forgiving mercy for Chriſts ſake: And then the voice of comfort and joy ſpeaks, <hi>Be of good chear, thy ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee;</hi> and writes this good news upon the conſcience. Why, this is right aſſurance, and right comfort of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There always goes <hi>a renewing and ſanctifying work of the Spirit,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A renewing and ſan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work.</note> before the <hi>aſſuring and witneſſing work</hi> of the Spirit; Here I will briefly clear two Points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>the ſanctifying work of the Spirit goes before the aſſuring work of the Spirit.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 21. He who hath <hi>anointed us, is God.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us.</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>He will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints.</hi> I beſeech you tell me whoſe portion is forgiveneſs of ſins and peace? Hath the Lord promiſed it unto any but unto his people? and who are indeed the people of God, but Saints, but holy people? ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royal Prieſthood, a holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi> God will forgive none their ſins, but ſuch as are his people, much leſs will he aſſure any that their ſins are forgiven but his people; and all the people of God (actually called into Covenant with him) are holy; therefore men muſt be ſanctified before they are aſſured.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It cannot be otherwiſe, whether you conſider</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>Nature of the Spirit of God.</hi> The Spirit of God is a holy Spirit, and he will not aford his preſence to any, unleſs he firſt make them holy; he always makes the Temple holy, in which he intends to abide and dwell; and if he will not abide in us, unleſs he ſanctifies us, will he give us the aſſurance of the great love of God in Chriſt, that our ſins are pardoned before he ſanctifies us?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You find in <hi>Experience,</hi> that when the people of God fall into ſin, and do oppoſe the ſanctifying work of the Spirit, preſently they loſe comfort and aſſurance; <hi>(David</hi> did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.) if we muſt uphold ſanctity, to preſerve the peace and comfort of the Spirit, ſurely then there muſt be ſanctity wrought before peace and aſſurance be ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A man muſt be <hi>in Chriſt</hi> before he can have propriety in the forgiveneſs of his ſins, and aſſurance that God hath for Chriſts ſake forgiven him; this all of you will grant, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Once more, Mark what God hath threatned to wicked and ungodly perſons, namely wrath and judgement, and deſtruction, and viſiting of their ſins upon them; this is the portion of their cup. Now would you have the Spirit of God to miſapply the Word of God? whatſoever God hath threatned or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his Word, that the Spirit of God is to apply; his work it is to apply threatnings, and his work it is to apply promiſes; and his office it is to apply the one and the other reſpectively to the perſons under the threatnings, and under the promiſes; he knows the mind of the Lord, and therefore as he will not apply the threatnings of wrath unto the godly, ſo he will not apply the promiſes of God to the wicked: and if ſo, then no aſſurance ſhall be by him applied unleſs men be holy. Therefore let no man deceive himſelf with a deluded perſwaſion or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that his ſins are pardoned, as long as he remains wicked, ungodly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy; no, no, the holy Spirit never ſeals any but holy perſons.</p>
                     <p>And there is a twofold holineſs wrought in us before the Spirit gives aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>Habitual,</hi> which is the renewing and changing of the heart into a conformity with the Image of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> in the life and converſation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23. <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of</hi>

                        </gap>y aſſured, yet this is true, that the Spirit of God aſſures no man, but firſt he ſanctifies him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There always goes the believing work before aſſuring work of the <note place="margin">Believing work</note> Spirit; the Spirit of God is a Spirit of faith, and then the Spirit of comfort or aſſurance. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe:</hi> Rom. 15. 13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.</hi> Mark, firſt believing, and then a filling with all joy and peace. Pſal. 13. 5. <hi>I have truſted in thy mercy, my heart ſhall rejoyce in thy ſalvation.</hi> This Aſſertion I ſuppoſe will paſs without diſpute, that the Spirit firſt works faith, and then aſſurance, and really it muſt be ſo; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

But it is <hi>by faith</hi> that <hi>we are children,</hi> Gal. 3. 26 And <hi>receive the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſons,</hi> Joh. 1. 12.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, There always goes <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>wrestling</hi> before this aſſuring <note place="margin">Praying and wreſtling.</note> work of the Spirit: The Spirit of ſupplication goes before the Spirit of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>They ſhall call upon my Name, and I will hear them; I will ſay it is my people, and they ſhall ſay the Lord is my God.</hi> Jer. 30. 21, 22. <hi>Who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ſaith the Lord? ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi> Iſa. 56. 7. <hi>Even them</hi> (eſpecially of thoſe that take hold of Gods Covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) <hi>will I bring to my holy Mountain, and will make them joyful in my houſe of prayer.</hi> Iſa 30. 19. <hi>He will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry, when he ſhall hear it, he will anſwer thee.</hi> Pſal. 35. 3. <hi>Say unto my ſoul, I am thy ſalvation.</hi> O what earneſt wreſtling prayer came from <hi>David</hi> before he could hear that voice of joy and gladneſs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. And this is ſo experimented a truth that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſweeteſt aſſurances do attend our deepeſt tears, and our higheſt prayers. If therefore the aſſurance which you finde concerning the pardon of your ſins, be the perſwaſion given to you by the Spirit of God, it doth alway follow mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of heart for ſin, and an holy change of heart, and faith in Chriſt, and on the promiſes of Chriſt, and earneſt prayer; if it be before, or without any of theſe, it is not the aſſurance of the Spirit of God, but a deluſion of our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="482" facs="tcp:55323:256"/>
Secondly, You may know that your aſſurance is the right aſſurance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by thoſe <hi>preſent appearing qualities which do always accompany the aſſurance</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying works.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>I will mention three of them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If it be the very aſſurance from the Spirit of God that your ſins in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

O Sirs, when the <hi>love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 5 5. (<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> and ſo it is when he aſſures us that God for his great love, and rich mercy hath forgiven us) never was the heart of tender wife more knit to her husband, than the heart of the aſſured ſinner is to his forgiving God; never did <hi>Jonathan</hi> delight more in <hi>David,</hi> than this poor ſoul doth in his God; why, he loves him ſo ſenſibly, ſo enlargedly, that he meditates and meditates, that he admires and admires, and cries out, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee?</hi> O I love thee for this love, for this mercy of mercies. <hi>Mary</hi> had <hi>many ſins forgiven her,</hi> and Chriſt aſſured her of it, therefore <hi>ſhe loved much, Luke</hi> 7. 47.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If it be the very aſſurance of the Spirit of God that your ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, <note place="margin">Softneſs of heart.</note> this will immediatly <hi>ſoften and melt your heart</hi> into ſuch pure ſprings of tears, that hardly you ever found the like for kind or degree. There are tears which a man ſheds before aſſurance for his ſins, and they are acceptable to God, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are ſomething brakiſh, and mixt with ſome trouble and diſtreſs; but the tears of ſorrow for ſinning againſt God, aſſuring us that he hath pardoned our ſins, they are ſo without all legality (if I may phraſe it ſo) they flow from the ſoul ſo freely, ſo tenderly, ſo feelingly, ſo abundantly; I think that a man never wept more bitterly, nor ever condemned himſelf more freely, nor ever was more aſhamed of himſelf and ſinnings, than at that time when God gave him his full diſcharge and pardon under the ſeal and witneſs of his own Spirit. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 61, 63. <hi>Aſhamed and confounded when God was pacified towards them.</hi> The Prophet expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the quality and the quantity of their mourning, in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>I but it ſhould rather produce joy!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> So it doth at the ſame time (which is ſtrange) the greateſt joy, and the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If it be the very aſſurance from the Spirit of God, the heart thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Humbleneſs of heart.</note> becomes ſo <hi>humble,</hi> and ſo <hi>lowly,</hi> and ſo nothing; the nearer that God draws to his people, the more humble they are; for when Gods Spirit aſſures us, he doth cauſe us to ſee our own unworthineſs, and the exceeding riches of Gods grace. Mark the men moſt eminent for aſſurance in Scripture, of all men they were the moſt humble and lowly. There are three men moſt high in aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo: <hi>He was ſtrong in faith, and he was fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> and he was a moſt humble man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20, 21. <hi>Behold I have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to ſpeak unto the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18. 27.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi> alſo was ſo; <hi>Thou art my God,</hi> Thou haſt forgiven my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and he alſo was a moſt humble man: <hi>Who am I O Lord God! and what is my fathers houſe!</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 18.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo; <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. yet this man was a very humble and lowly man: <hi>The leaſt of the Apoſtles;</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 9. <hi>Leſs than the leaſt of all Saints.</hi> Eph. 3. 8. <hi>and not meet to be called an Apoſtle.</hi> O Chriſtian, you who talk how much and how long you have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, where is this high love? where is this deep ſorrow? where is this humble lowlineſs? did your aſſurance ever produce theſe in you? if not, aſſuredly you have mock't your ſouls all this while with vain deluſions.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You may know that your aſſurance is right, and comes from the very <note place="margin">By the effects flowing from aſſurance.</note> Spirit of God by theſe <hi>ſingular fruits and effects which (conſequently) do flow from your aſſurance;</hi> I will mention ſix of them.</p>
                     <list>
                        <pb n="483" facs="tcp:55323:256"/>
                        <item>1. Quietation of heart.</item>
                        <item>2. More care to walk in all well-pleaſing before the Lord.</item>
                        <item>3. More regard unto, and delight in the Word.</item>
                        <item>4. More zeal.</item>
                        <item>5. More fear.</item>
                        <item>6. More height of heart.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, One effect which flows from a right aſsurance that our ſins are forgiven, is a <note place="margin">Quietation of heart.</note> 
                        <hi>preſent quietation of heart;</hi> all ſtorms ceaſe upon one word ſpoken from the Spirit. There were many doubts, and many fears, and many diſputes, and many reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and many ſad thoughts, and reſtleſs motions in the ſoul; but when aſsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of forgiveneſs is given in by the Spirit of God to our ſpirits, all theſe do ceaſe, and there enſues a gracious calme in the conſcience, even an excuſing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and joyful reſt. When God <hi>lifted up the light of his countenance upon David, he lay down in peace,</hi> Pſal. 4. 6, 8.</p>
                     <p>Now this quietation differs much from that. Stupidity in a man deluded with a falſe aſsurance; for</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This ſtupidity is not the quieting of a troubled ſoul, but ſo is this.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Their quietneſs is the effect rather of ignorance, becauſe they do not know their miſerable condition, than of aſsurance, that they do certainly know their pardoned condition.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Their quietneſs is from a ſeared conſcience, but not from an aſsured and pacified conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is a paſſive ſilence, but in this conſcience doth witneſs, and the heart rejoyceth. Well then, ſpiritual and joyful reſt or quietation is the proper fruit of true aſsurance; and verily it cannot but be ſo; for aſsurance (in the very nature of it) doth ſo ſatisfie the mind, and prevail upon it, as to exclude all actual doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and fears at that time; and it is a clear manifeſtation of Gods love and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mercy, with our propriety in them in particular, and therefore neceſsarily doth quietation of heart flow from it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>More carefulneſs to walk in all well-pleaſing before the Lord;</hi> aſsurance <note place="margin">Carefulneſs to walk in all well-pleaſing.</note> breeds two excellent properties about holy walking and ſervices.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is <hi>more alacrity;</hi> O it is now no burden, but <hi>a delight to do the will of God.</hi> Pſal. 40. 8. <hi>I delight to do thy will,</hi> and <hi>thy commands are my delight,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, I will run the way of thy Commandments when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart,</hi> Pſ. 119. 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is <hi>more carefulneſs:</hi> Mark that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 1. <hi>I have walked in mine integrity.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>For thy loving kindneſs is before mine eyes.</hi> Never were any more ſtrict in paths of righteouſneſs, than thoſe who have taſted moſt of Gods lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs: <hi>I am thy ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 116. 16.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>More delight in the Word,</hi> and greater <hi>appetite</hi> after it. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>As</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Delight in the Word.</note> 
                        <hi>new born baves deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby, if ſo be that ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>More zeal for God;</hi> What will not this aſsured Chriſtian act and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> he will do any ſervice for Chriſt; yea, the higheſt and greateſt, <hi>(the love of Chriſt conſtrains him,</hi> 2 Cor. 14.) nay, he will dye for Chriſt; <hi>but to dye for the Name of Chriſt,</hi> Acts 21. 13. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> Gal. 2. 20. What ſhall I render to the Lord? what ſhall I do for my God? <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>I charge you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtir not up, nor awake my love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>More fear to ſin againſt God;</hi> let me tell you a truth, the aſsured perſon <note place="margin">Fear to ſin.</note> would even dye preſently in the Arms of Chriſt, that he might never ſin againſt him any more; but ſee <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3. 5. <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>An height of heart;</hi> preſently the heart is above all the world, the world <note place="margin">Height of heart.</note> is nothing, of no account when the Lord once gives in the aſsurance of his love in the pardon of our ſins in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>I now proceed to the ſecond queſtion, which is this, What thoſe weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
                        <pb n="484" facs="tcp:55323:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>and Believers ſhould judge of their eſtate, who never yet could attain unto this particular aſſurance of the pardon of their ſins, and what courſe they may take to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What weak Chriſtians ſhould judge of their eſtates, who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are two things in this queſtion to be ſpoken unto. 1. One reſpects the ſupport. 2. The other reſpects the direction of ſuch Chriſtians as have not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the aſsurance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>1. For <hi>the ſupport</hi> of thoſe weak believers who are apt to judge heavily of themſelves, and of their ſpiritual eſtate, becauſe they never yet attained to the pardon of their ſins, I would preſent theſe four Concluſions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, One <hi>may be in a juſtified or pardoned estate in the Court of heaven, who as yet</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A man may be in a pardoned ſtate, who is not aſſured.</note> 
                        <hi>is not in an aſſured eſtate in the Court of his own conſcience;</hi> ſins may be forgiven, when yet the ſinner is not aſſured of the forgiveneſs of his ſins. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſins,</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> prayed exceedingly to get the aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8. <hi>Make me to hear joy and gladneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 14. 20. <hi>At that day</hi> (after his Aſcenſion) <hi>ye ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> Ye ſhall know, &amp;c. yet of theſe he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>I am the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine, ye are the Branches.</hi> Job 13. 24. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine enemy?</hi> Pſal 88. 14. <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my ſoul? why hideſt thou thy face from me?</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>Whiles I ſuffer thy terror, I am diſtracted.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy terrors have cut me off.</hi> Iſa. 64 8. <hi>But now O Lord thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou art the potter, and we all are the work of thine hand.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Be not wroth very ſore O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever; behold, ſee we beſeech thee, we are all thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Mark, though thou art our Father, and we are thy people, <hi>yet be not wroth, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, If one doth truly believe in Chriſt, <hi>his condition is ſure, although the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">His condition is ſure, though his perſon have not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> 
                        <hi>perſon hath not aſſurance;</hi> true faith, (though weak, though compaſſed with doubts and fears) doth really make Chriſt to be yours; and if Chriſt be yours, then your condition is ſure. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life.</hi> Joh. 10. 27. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</hi> Ver. 28. <hi>and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> Joh. 6. 47. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erily, verily I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlaſting life.</hi> Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, neither Chriſt nor ſalvation are ſetled upon aſſurance, but upon faith; it is not ſaid that Chriſt dwells in our hearts by aſsurance, but by faith; nor is it ſaid, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is aſsured ſhall be ſaved, nor Whoſoever is aſsured ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins, but Whoſoever believeth. The weakeſt true faith is enough to make Chriſt to be yours, and conſequently it is enough to give you an intereſt in his Redemption, and to free you from condemnation, and to bring you to that purchaſed inheritance of life; ſee then, this is another comfort; though you have not aſsurance, yet the condition of life is ſure if ye be true believers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A third ſupport is this, <hi>Though you have not the aſſurance of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Though you have not this aſſurance, yet you are labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it.</note> 
                        <hi>of your ſins, yet you are labouring and ſtriving for it;</hi> there are degrees of aſsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; ſome are weaker, ſome are ſtronger; ſome are more permanent, ſome are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient. Beloved, though a man be not in heaven, yet it is a great comfort if he be walking towards heaven; though a man be not in Chriſt, yet it is good when he is crying out for Chriſt; and ſo though a man hath not as yet the aſsurance that his ſins are pardoned, it is a good ſign when he is found in the ways for aſsurance.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But what comfort is there in this, that one is labouring for aſſurance, when as yet he never had it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There is in this four comforts to them that labour for aſsurance.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>comfort of obedience,</hi> that you are (according to Gods commands) giving all <hi>diligence to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. and <hi>proving and trying your ſelves,</hi> whether Chriſt be in you of a truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and <hi>working out your ſalvation,</hi> Phil. 2. 12.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>comfort of ſincerity,</hi> that you are on the way to be aſsured, not reſting in the want of aſsurance, nor in idle complaints, but as you pretend, an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:55323:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and judgement, rightly valuing it, and that your hearts are ſet upon it, ſo your ſouls are indeed drawn forth to the ways of enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>comfort of Gods preſence;</hi> for it is from the Spirit of God that your hearts do thus prize, and thus long for, and thus labour for aſsurance; he begets thoſe thoughts, and thoſe deſires, and thoſe prayers; you have the preſence of the Spirit, though not the aſsurance of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>comfort of hope,</hi> that at length you ſhall ſee the God of gods in <hi>Zion,</hi> that you ſhall ſee his face with joy, that he will create peace and aſsurance in your hearts; for he never fills the ſoul and ſtirs and draws it unto himſelf for his gracious favour, but at length he doth make his loving kindneſs known unto that ſoul; and he doth thus prepare the heart, becauſe he will incline his ear.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A fourth ſupport unto you is this, although you have not this aſſurance <hi>in your own hearts,</hi> yet you have <hi>it in Gods promiſe,</hi> who aſſures you that he will ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle it upon you, and faithful is he who hath promiſed, who will alſo do it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But now I come unto the Direction which I would commend to weak <note place="margin">Direction.</note> believers for the attaining of their aſſurance, and they are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Diligent attendance upon the Word of God;</hi> that this is a good means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God hath <hi>inſtituted</hi> or <hi>ordained his Word,</hi> not only for the <hi>converſion,</hi> but alſo for the <hi>conſolation</hi> of his people, and the aſſuring of them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4 <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 4. <hi>Theſe things write we unto you that your joy may be full.</hi> 1 Joh. 13. <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that ye have eternal life.</hi> Mark, written for our comfort, written that our joy may be full, written that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may know they have eternal life; why then unqueſtionably the Word is a means to attain aſſurance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The people of God have attended the Word for this very end, to gain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 9. <hi>We have thought of thy loving kindneſs O God in the midſt of thy Temple.</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>I will hearken what God the Lord will speak, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They have <hi>found aſſurance upon the attending on the Word.</hi> Pſal. 63. 1. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my ſoul thirſteth for thee.</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>To ſee thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thy glory ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>Becauſe thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than life.</hi> He had ſeen experimentally the power and the glory of God in the Sanctuary; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the mercy and the loving kindneſs of God in Chriſt, the aſſurance and feeling of it in the uſe of the Word, &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom ye alſo trusted after that ye heard the Word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalvation; in whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Fervent prayer</hi> unto the Lord, this is alſo a means to obtain aſsurance. <note place="margin">Fervent prayer.</note> 
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 58. <hi>I intreated thy favour with my whole heart;</hi> and two things demonſtrate this unto us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some <hi>ſpecial promiſes</hi> to this purpoſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Iſa. 56. 7. <hi>Even them will I bring to my holy Mountain, and will make them joyful in my houſe of prayer, &amp;c.</hi> What is that which makes the heart of the people of God joyful? <hi>David</hi> tells you in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us;</hi> and <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, &amp;c.</hi> and where is this joyfulneſs promiſed? by what means? <hi>I will make them joyful in my houſe of prayer.</hi> Joh. 16. 24. <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> Here is a fulneſs of joy, (and that certainly is in aſsurance) and that fulneſs of joy is promiſed upon prayer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some <hi>particular experiences.</hi> Pſal. 30. 10. <hi>Hear O Lord, and have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>Thou haſt turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou haſt put off my ſackcloth, and girded me with gladneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="486" facs="tcp:55323:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Object. <hi>But will ſome ſay, We have heard the Word a long time, and we have prayed and ſought the Lord a long time, and yet we cannot attain to this aſſurance of forgiveneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Therefore be ſure to take in three things when you pray for this aſſurance.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Apious valuation of it; Thy favour is life,</hi> Pſal. 30. 5. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than life,</hi> Pſal. 63 3. <hi>O viſit me with thy ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 106 4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A believing perſwaſion</hi> that God will hear you in this <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> and that Spirit is the Spirit of <hi>Adoption, that witneſſeth with our spirits that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 16. <hi>David</hi> hath a ſingular paſſage in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 147. <hi>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the dawning of the morning, and cryed, I hoped in thy Word;</hi> where obſerve three things. 1. The earlineſs of his prayer, <hi>(I prevented the dawning of the morning)</hi> he could not ſleep, but muſt ariſe and pray. 2. The earneſtneſs of his prayer, <hi>(I cried)</hi> he was ſolemn, ſerious and fervent. 3. The faith with his prayer, <hi>(and I hoped in thy Word)</hi> in one of theſe our prayers do fail, and ſo we get not our aſſurance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A patient expectation,</hi> a continuance in prayer, ſtill importuning the Lord, and waiting on him for this great teſtimony of his pardoning mercy. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30 18. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>I will hearken what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Ingredients are ſtill to be remembred, and taken in, if you would prevail for the aſſurance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>A conſcientious care in all our ways to walk before God in all well-pleaſing.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care to walk in all well-pleaſing.</note> A godly walking brings moſt glory to God, and moſt comfort to our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; there are two excellent places for this purpoſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 17. <hi>The work of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall be peace,</hi> and the <hi>effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> Joh. 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, is he that loveth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my ſelf unto him.</hi> I beſeech you to remember five paſſages.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>men who make no conſcience of their ways,</hi> but walk licentiouſly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, they <hi>can never come to their aſſurance.</hi> Iſa. 59. 8. <hi>The way of peace they know not.</hi> Iſa. 57. 21. <hi>There is no peace ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> Pſal. 119. 155. <hi>Salvation is far from the wicked, for they ſeek not thy ſtatutes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>the people of God for particular failings</hi> in a conſcientious and careful walking, have <hi>forfeited their aſſurance; David</hi> did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8, 11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That aſſurance is frequently <hi>promiſed to an upright, conſcientious, careful walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Pſal. 11. 7. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, his countenance doth behold the upright.</hi> Pſal. 50 23. <hi>To him that ordereth his Converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That ſuch perſons <hi>have found abundance of joy and comfort.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſh wiſdome,</hi> but by the grace of God, <hi>we had our Converſation.</hi> Pſal. 119. 165. <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That <hi>all perſons that do thus walk,</hi> and continue ſo to do, (although for ſome ſpace of time they may not finde this aſſurance yet) <hi>they ſhall at length enjoy it.</hi> Pſal. 97. 11, <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. One is, that ſtill much of ſinful corruption dwells in you; though aſsurance doth (for the preſent) clear the mind of all doubts, yet it doth not cleanſe the heart of all ſins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, that temptations uſually attend aſsurances, (Satan is an enemy to our comforts as well as our graces) and ſometimes they prevail over us if they find us careleſs.</p>

                  <p>In them there are three things very obſervable.</p>

3. The Reaſons why God promiſeth the one with the other.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>diſtinction or difference 'twixt Juſtification and Sanctification;</hi> for they <note place="margin">The difference between Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Sanctification.</note> are promiſed as two diſtinct or ſeveral gifts <hi>(I will alſo, &amp;c.)</hi> which could not be ſpoken if they were both of them one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>They differ thus,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is in Juſtification <hi>a change of the ſtate;</hi> he who was in the ſtate <note place="margin">They differ in ſix things.</note> of death, and wrath, being juſtified, is in the ſtate of life and love <hi>(he is paſſed from death to life)</hi> but in Sanctification of the heart, he who was unholy, is now made holy, his heart is changed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Juſtification looks at the <hi>guilt of ſin,</hi> and frees us from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>(There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.) But Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion looks at the <hi>filth of ſin,</hi> and frees us from the dominion of ſin: <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the Law but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In Juſtification there is the <hi>righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us,</hi> for which God accounts us righteous; but in Sanctification there is <hi>grace infuſed into us,</hi> by which we are made conformable unto the image of Chriſt; that depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>merit</hi> of Chriſt, and this depends upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt.</p>

                           </gap>ification is perfect,</hi> and without any defect and exception (the juſtice of God cannot finde any want in the obedience of Chriſt which was full and compleat, and perfectly ſatisfied the Law of God) but the matter of our ſanctification is <hi>imperfect,</hi> and weak, and we cannot ſtand before Gods Judgment-ſeat with it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, All who are juſtified, <hi>are juſtified alike;</hi> there is no difference amongſt believers as to their Juſtification; one is not more juſtified than another (for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtified perſon hath a plenary Remiſſion of his ſins, and the ſame righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed) but in Sanctification there <hi>is difference</hi> amongſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; every one is not ſanctified alike, but ſome are ſtronger and higher, and ſome are weaker and lower in grace.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, In Juſtification there is <hi>nothing of ſin remaining,</hi> which hath any cotra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the juſtified eſtate; but in Sanctification there is ſomething of ſin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſanctified perſon, which is contrary to that grace which is wrought in us by the Holy Spirit; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2ly <hi>The Connexion of Sanctification with Juſtification.</hi> You may read in <note place="margin">The connexion of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> Scripture of a four-fold conjunction of theſe two great gifts of God unto his people.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In <hi>the promiſes of the Covenant,</hi> they joyn hand in hand, come forth like <note place="margin">A four-fold cennexion. In the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> twins out of the womb of grace; <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity whereby they have ſinned againſt me, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have ſinned and whereby they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> Here you ſee them both expreſſed together in the ſame deed: I will <hi>cleanſe</hi> them from all their iniquity, there is our ſanctification promiſed: And I will <hi>pardon</hi> all their iniquities, there is juſtification promiſed: <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi> Here you finde them again in promiſe: He will ſubdue our iniquities, this is ſanctifying; and he will caſt all, &amp;c. there is juſtifying: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I will put my Laws into their mindes, and write them in their hearts;</hi> (there is the promiſe of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In people of the Covenant:</hi> All who are effectually called and <note place="margin">In the people of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> brought into Covenant, they are juſtified, and they are ſanctified, they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

of mercy, and they partake of grace: <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. He is made holy; ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Of him are ye all in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification.</hi> So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> Chap. 2. 1. <hi>And you hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>deſires of the people of the Covenant:</hi> Their hearts are drawn <note place="margin">In the deſires of the people of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> forth with the deſires of both; Pſal. 51. 1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy loving-kindneſs: according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tranſgreſſions:</hi> Here is earneſt prayer for mercy to pardon ſin. Ver. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me;</hi> here is earneſt prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for grace to ſanctifie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>In the Mediatour of the Covenant,</hi> who is the <hi>Head</hi> of his Church, as well <note place="margin">In the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</note> as the <hi>Saviour</hi> of his body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>And gave himſelf for it that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the Word.</hi> Ver. 26. as well as to <hi>waſh it from its ſins in his own blood.</hi> Rev. 1. 5. <hi>And gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people zealous of good works.</hi> Tit. 2. 19. <hi>And bare our iniquities in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs; by whoſe ſtripes we are healed:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. He was anointed not only to be our <hi>Prieſt</hi> to take away our ſins by his body, but alſo to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto us the whole will of God: (And this is <hi>the will of God, even our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 3.)</p>
                     <p>3ly The Reaſons why God doth promiſe theſe two great Gifts of holineſs and forgiveneſs; to ſanctifie his people as well as to juſtifie them. There <note place="margin">Reaſons why God doth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie as well as juſtifie. Both have a neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> may be theſe Reaſons for their Connexion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Both of them have a neceſſary reſpect to the ſalvation of the people of God:</hi> A man muſt be juſtified if he will be ſaved; and a man muſt be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied if he will be ſaved; he cannot be ſaved without both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cannot be ſaved unleſs he be juſtified: Rom. 8. 30. <hi>Whom he called, them alſo he juſtified;</hi> and whom he <hi>juſtified,</hi> them he <hi>alſo glorified:</hi> None are juſtified: but ſuch as are called, and none are glorified but ſuch as are juſtified: Mar. 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> He cannot be ſaved unleſs he be ſanctified: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Jeſus anſwered. Verily, very, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdom of God:</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>And holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> Here you ſee a neceſſity of both of them in reference to ſalvation; we many times think that if our ſins are pardoned, there needed no more to ſave us, but we are deceived; for as forgiveneſs is neceſſary, ſo is holineſs neceſſary to our ſalvation; as no unpardoned perſon, ſo no unſanctified perſon ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The people of God do ſtand in need of them both;</hi> neither can they be <note place="margin">Gods people ſtand in need of both.</note> reſtored or repaired without both; for the ſinnes which are in them, are</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Guilty obligations;</hi> they bind them over to wrath and curſe.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Filthy pollutions;</hi> they do ſtain and defile them, and make them odious in the eyes of God: Under the firſt notion they are a debt; and under the other notion they are a diſeaſe; and under both they render us needy of mercy and of grace. Pardoning mercy alone doth not anſwer the ſinful condition of man, for that is a remedy only againſt the guilt of ſin; ſanctifying mercy is alſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be a recovery from the filthy pollution of ſin: As if one be a ſick Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, this man hath a double need; he needs a pardon as he is a Malefactor, and he needs a healing medicine and plaiſter as he is ſick. Now the Covenant of grace is a full remedy to the ſinner, and it is a full recovery: <hi>Ergo,</hi> God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſanctifie as well as to juſtifie.</p>
                     <p>

Thirdly, <hi>God doth intend an everlaſting communion twixt his people and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>

                        <hi>in the Covenant;</hi> a communion in this life, and a communion in the other life; and indeed the people of God, <hi>their fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Christ:</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 3. <hi>They are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt, and have acceſſe unto him:</hi> But they muſt be ſanctified as well as juſtified for the enjoying of that communion; becauſe two things are oppoſite to our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God.</p>
                     <p>1. One is <hi>enmity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The other is <hi>inconformity.</hi> Whiles God and we are enemies, how can there be communion between us? Therefore in juſtification that enmity is removed and ſlain by the blood of Chriſt; and whiles God is holy, and we remain unholy, there is ſuch a diſſimilitude, and inconformity of our natures, that there can be no communion neither; and therefore God doth ſanctifie our hearts by his Spirit, that we partaking of the Divine Nature by way of ſimilitude, may have fellowſhip and communion with him: Pardon of ſins only, makes not ſufficient way for this communion; for notwithſtanding that pardoning mercy, the heart of man is ſo ſinfull, that God cannot endure us, being of purer eyes than to behold ſin: <hi>Put away your iniquities from before mine eyes, and then come and let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 1.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>We cannot glorifie God, unleſſe he ſanctifie us:</hi> Beloved, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are formed by him to ſhew forth his praiſe; they are the only people <note place="margin">We cannot glorifie God without ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</note> that do glorifie him, and honour him: But this cannot be unleſs he were pleaſed to ſanctifie them; God indeed can glorifie himſelf towards us, though we be not holy; but we cannot glorifie him untill we are made holy; we cannot glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him <hi>in our hearts;</hi> for what glory can God have by an unbelieving, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hardened, ſenſual, ignorant, proud, ungodly heart? Nor in <hi>our actions;</hi> for they are as our hearts are; the fruit is as the tree is, &amp;c. What can a dead or a ſick man do for ſervice?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, we ſhould have ſmall comfort and peace, if the Lord did not ſanctifie as well as juſtifie us; to have ſinfull luſts ſtill raigning, and ruling, and breaking out, this would make our life uncomfortable.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Are not the people of the Covenant his children? and would you have the holy Father to be the Father of unholy children? is this to be born of the Spirit? <hi>Whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and whatſoever is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.</p>

As the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt hath its proper excellency to juſtifie us, ſo hath holineſs its proper excellency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new us, to conform us unto Chriſt; and to make us to walk as becometh men in Chriſt: Beſides, would God have made Chriſt to be our Sanctification as well as our Righteouſneſs, if holineſs did not concern us as well as faith? and would he have joyned Remiſſion of ſinnes with the ſanctifying of our hearts, if

It alſo <hi>reproves</hi> the <hi>general preſumption of men,</hi> who think of nothing <note place="margin">Reproof of the general preſumption of men.</note> in order to their ſalvation but Gods mercy; they talk much of mercy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem affectionate for mercy to pardon their ſins, and never mind holineſs, nor how to get their hearts to be ſanctified? Nay, they oppoſe holineſs, and ſcoff, and ſcorn at holineſs. Theſe men will loſe their ſouls, becauſe both of theſe which God hath promiſed, are neceſſary for ſalvation; you muſt have your ſins pardoned, or elſe you cannot be ſaved; and ſo you muſt have your hearts ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or elſe you cannot be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>But you may ſay unto me, why do men look only after mercy, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why men look after mercy and not holineſs.</note> 
                        <hi>not alſo after holineſſe, ſeeing God hath joyned them together in his promiſe, and both muſt be in perſons which will be ſaved?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſons may be theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Holineſſe is more contrary to mans ſinful nature than mercy:</hi> Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed relieves the ſinner in a more eaſie and delightful way; but holineſs though it doth relieve the ſinner, yet it doth it in a way more croſs to our ſinfull love, for it fights againſt our ſins, and doth purge, and work them out from our hearts, and will not ſuffer ſin to bear Rule there.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though <hi>holineſs</hi> be the <hi>way to heaven,</hi> yet ſinfull men <hi>do not look on it as ſo;</hi> but they look on it as the way of trouble and reproach, as a way that is contradicted, and expoſing them to croſſes, loſſes, and contempts, and which is too ſevere againſt their carnal liberties, and pleaſures, and wills, and therefore they like it not. No man reproacheth another becauſe he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but becauſe he is ſanctified; for ſanctification is a reproach and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the evil wayes of men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Doth God promiſe to ſanctifie his people as well as to juſtifie <note place="margin">Be not content with the one, without the other.</note> them? Then <hi>be not content with the one without the other,</hi> but joyn them in your prayers, which God hath joyned in his promiſes: Be not ſatisfied that you ſins are pardoned; neither be ſatisfied that your hearts be ſanctified; as he cryed out, <hi>Domine! de penitentiam &amp; da indulgentiam;</hi> ſo do you, Lord give me grace, and Lord give me mercy. God is a holy God as well as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God; and Jeſus Chriſt came <hi>by water and blood,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 6. Let your hearts be earneſtly carried out for both; To this end remember ſix Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Though <hi>your Right and Title to heaven lies in Juſtification,</hi> yet your <hi>meetneſſe and fitneſſe for heaven lies in your Sanctification:</hi> Col. 1. 12. <hi>Giving thanks unto God the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> Acts 20. 32. <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among all them that are ſanctified.</hi> Is it meet or fit that an ungodly perſon ſhould be in heavenly glory! The Leper had a right to his houſe, yet was not fit to dwell in it untill he was cleanſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When you look at the pardon of your ſins, <hi>you ſeem to look more at your ſelves</hi> (your own ſafety, your own peace, your own deliverance from wrath and hell) but when you look after ſanctification, you rather look <hi>more at Gods glory</hi> how you may be enabled to honour him more: 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>Yea are a choſen generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people, that you ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi>
                     </p>

How can this be, if Chriſt be not your ſanctification, as well as Righteouſneſs, if you be not partakers of his Spirit, as well as of his merit! if you do not dye and live with him.</p>

Fourthly, It is a <hi>ſign of a naughty heart;</hi> when mercy alone is deſired, and that only will ſatisfie: In an exigence the moſt wicked man will cry out for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but he never cries for ſanctity. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> put <hi>Moſes</hi> upon it to pray that God would forgive his ſinne, but never that God would heale his hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, As <hi>God promiſeth the one as well as the other, ſo he will never give the one without the other:</hi> If he juſtifies you, he likewiſe ſanctifies you; and if you are not ſanctified, aſſuredly you are not juſtified: when you are by Faith united to Chriſt, your communion immediately falls in for ſanctification as well for Righteouſneſs: And it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould be yours, but you muſt have the Spirit of Chriſt; (Rom. 8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his)</hi> and that Spirit quickning us with a new life, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies our luſts: Some hold that ſanctification is an inſeparable effect of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but unqueſtionably it is a companion of it, and a lively teſtimony of it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Becauſe <hi>he promiſeth both,</hi> therefore ſeeke for both; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. God promiſeth nothing that is ſuperfluous, or uſeleſs; but it is good, and for our good.</item>
                        <item>2. He promiſeth no good, which he 1. Is not able to perform: And 2ly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to perform.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Holineſs is an excellent good; it is the image of God, it is the glory of God, it is called <hi>glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. it is the glory and excellency (an unholy perſon is but vile and baſe) the Saints are <hi>the excellent on the earth;</hi> Pſal. 16. 2.

                     <p n="1">1. No man can impart any of his own grace unto another; he cannot divide the grace which he hath, as he can the earthly eſtate which he hath amongſt his children: The actings of his grace may extend to others; but the habit or quality of his grace he can no more impart to others, than he can his own ſoul or life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All that we <hi>can do for others</hi> (to work grace in them) is but in a moral way of counſel, and exhortation, and entreaty, and reaſoning; but we cannot open their ears to hear that counſel, nor their hearts to receive that grace unto which they are by us exhorted; nor can we expect that our exhortations ſhould have more power to prevail with men than Gods exhortations; yet theſe alone were not ſufficient to change any ſinner without ſome inward workings of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon the ſpirits of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Beſides, to <hi>change the heart</hi> of a ſinner by grace, is a work proportionable <note place="margin">This is a work of Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> with <hi>Creation,</hi> and with the reſurrection of the dead (ſo the Scripture ſtiles our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or ſanctification) for which Omnipotency muſt put forth it ſelf, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us. <note place="margin">God can do it.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God can ſanctifie, or graciouſly change the heart of a ſinner;</hi> which may thus appear.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He hath <hi>dominion</hi> and power <hi>over the heart;</hi> he can turn, and command, and rule it as he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>dominion over all grace;</hi> he can give it, and work it in the heart of men by his Almighty Spirit and Power. If he will ſay to the dead, Live, the dead ſhall live; if he will ſay to the blind, See, the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and they ſhall ſee: If he will ſay to the deaf, Hear, the ears of the deaf ſhall be opened, and they ſhall hear. If he will ſay to the moſt wicked heart, Be thou changed, it ſhall be changed and healed; for by his Spirit he can infuſe that grace into the heart, and with that power, and with that efficacy, as ſhall be ſufficient to beat down and ſubdue all the reſiſtances of ſin, and to renew and alter the whole ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God <hi>doth undertake this ſanctifying work</hi> in promiſe for his people; <note place="margin">God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes this work</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That they may know that be alone is the Original and Author of all their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good:</hi> No Fountain of mercy, but their God of mercy; and no Fountain of grace, but their God of grace; no Fountain of peace, and ſalvation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but their God of peace, but their God of ſalvation, but their God of comfort.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>their hearts might be ſupported</hi> under the ſenſe of their ſinfulneſs, and under the ſenſe of their want of holineſs, and under the ſenſe of their own inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and inability to give themſelves any holineſs. Though they cannot, though no creature can help their hearts to holineſs; yet their God can and will; for he hath promiſed it to them, and he is able to perform what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and is alſo able, and will do it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That <hi>he might have the glory,</hi> that we may glory in him, and not in our ſelves; for what have we that we have not received? <note place="margin">Let no man take this work upon him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a confidence of his own ſtrength.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Doth God himſelf undertake to ſanctifie the hearts of his people? Then let none <hi>take upon him this work upon a confidence of his own will,</hi> and power, and ſufficiency: will you take the work of God out of his hand! When <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob, Give me children or elſe I dye?</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Am I in Gods stead!</hi> Gen. 30. 1, 2.
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:55323:263"/>
So when the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſent <hi>Naaman</hi> to the <hi>King of Iſrael</hi> to heal him of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, ſaid he, <hi>Am I God, to kill, and make alive, that this man doth ſend to me to recover a man of his leproſie!</hi> 2 Kin. 5. 7. So, will you be in Gods ſtead! will you be Gods to yourſelves, that you take on you to change and ſanctifie your own hearts! and yet men are frequently preſumptuous in this, they will change their hearts, and they will become new men. Is not this a preſumptuous, nay is it not an impoſſible work? will you create, will you quicken the dead?</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But doth not God bid us?</hi> Make unto your ſelves a new heart, <hi>and</hi> a new ſpirit? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31.</p>

                        <item>3. That we might apply our ſelves to the means through which he will work this.</item>

                     <p>2. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> In the <hi>ſenſe of want of holineſs, be not diſcouraged,</hi> give not up the work <note place="margin">Be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in the ſenſe of the want of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> as impoſſible; ſay not I ſhall never ſee a change in my heart, my ſins are ſo ſtrong, and my power is nothing; but go to God, remember that he hath undertaken to ſanctifie; <hi>Maſter, If thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> ſaid the poor Leper; ſaid Chriſt, <hi>I will, be thou clean;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Remember five things in this that God himſelf undertakes to give grace or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs by promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He <hi>intends</hi> to give what he promiſeth in any Particular.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He <hi>is able to work it;</hi> nothing is able to ſtand againſt his promiſe; nothing can hinder it; all the power of hell, and of thy ſinful heart cannot hinder him from the healing and ſanctifying according to promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He <hi>doth put thee but upon coming,</hi> and asking, and truſting: <hi>He will give hiss holy Spirit to them that ask,</hi> Luke 11. 13. Believe only and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thou ſhalt ſee his power.</p>
                     <p>Fouthly, You cannot <hi>put up a requeſt that doth more concern his own glory;</hi> Lord let me not diſhonour thee any more, grieve thee any more; ſanctifie and change my heart that I may bring thee glory.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He <hi>never denied</hi> any heart that was ſerious and fixed in deſires of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>

                     <p>FOr the opening of this great and neceſſary Truth, I will ſpeak unto a few <note place="margin">God gives a new heart and a new ſpirit to his people in Covenant. What is meant by heart and ſpirit. Heart taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly.</note> Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is meant by heart and spirit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The word <hi>(heart)</hi> is taken</p>
                     <p>Sometimes <hi>Phyſically,</hi> for that noble and vital part of man, which is the ſeat of the ſoul, and life in man: Thus it is not looked on in this place. Sometimes it is taken for the <hi>ſoule</hi> of man which hath its principal reſidence in the heart: Gen. 6. 5. <hi>God ſaw that every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart was only evil continually</hi> (of mans heart <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of mans ſoul) Prov. 23. 26. <hi>My Son, give me thy heart; (i. e.)</hi> thy ſoul, thy will, thy affections; thus it is taken in this place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That word <hi>(Spirit)</hi> is in Scripture taken ſometimes in oppoſition <note place="margin">Spirit how taken.</note> to the body of man, as in Eccleſ. 12. 7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt (i. e.)</hi> the body of man <hi>return to the earth as it was; and the ſpirit (i. e.)</hi> the ſoul <hi>ſhall return to God who gave it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometime it is put in a direct <hi>diſtinction from the ſoule,</hi> as in 1 Theſ. 5. 23. <hi>I pray God that your whole ſpirit, and ſoul, and body be preſerved blameleſs, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Spirit denotes the intellectual part, and the ſoule denotes the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And ſo I humbly conceive the word <hi>(Spirit)</hi> is taken in the Text: Namely for the mind and judgement (called the intellectual part of man) and the word <hi>(Heart)</hi> is taken for the will and affections; and by both is meant all the ſoul, the whole ſoul in all the faculties of it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is a <hi>ſubſtantial newneſſe,</hi> where all the materials are ſo; as an houſe is new, and a garment is new, and a ſhip is new, being all made of new materials: under this notion God doth not give a new heart, and a new ſpirit unto his people; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he doth not give unto them another ſoul for ſubſtance from what formerly they had; they have one and the ſame ſubſtantial ſoul ſtill, &amp;c. all the ſame eſſential faculties of the ſoul ſtill, the ſame faculty of underſtanding, the ſame will, the ſame affections ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is an <hi>accidental newneſs,</hi> where the ſubſtance remaines the ſame, yet the qualities ſupervinient, or ſuper-added to the ſubſtance are new: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> As when a Garment is cut into a new faſhion; or a piece of Plate is melted and purged of its droſs, and made clean and pure, we call thoſe new, though not for ſubſtance, yet for qualities: <hi>Naaman</hi> was the ſame man when he was <hi>a Leper,</hi> and when he was cured, the cure was accidental. In this reſpect God gives a new heart, and a new ſpirit, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he doth (as it were) new ſhape the heart and ſpirit; he puts into them ſuch gracious qualities which are oppoſite to the wicked or ſinful qualities in them before.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are called new, not in <hi>oppoſition to our Creation</hi> (for God made us holy and righteous) but in oppoſition <hi>to our degeneration;</hi> for by the fall we loſt all our excellencies, and corrupted our hearts, and filled them with all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, with ſinful corruptions: when God doth purge out of our hearts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth into them the graces of his Spirit, then are our hearts ſaid to be new, and our <note place="margin">This newneſs of heart</note> ſpirits are ſaid to be renewed. This only in the general: Now I ſhall more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly diſcover unto you what this newneſs of heart is which God doth promiſe unto his people. <note place="margin">Deſcribed.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is that great and eminent change wrought in all the ſoul by the Spirit of Chriſt, infuſing a new principle of grace, which inclines and conformes the heart to the whole will of God, and oppoſeth and mortifieth all the old ſinful luſt formerly reſiding and prevailing in the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many particulars in this deſcription which I ſhall in order unfold unto you.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>A new heart is a changed heart;</hi> Newneſs (in the very nature of it) <note place="margin">A new heart is a changed heart.</note> implies an alteration; for whatſoever is altogther the ſame that it was, cannot be ſaid to be new. If the heart was ignorant, and ſo remains ſtill; if it was proud, and vain, and filthy, and earthly, and ſo remaines ſtill; this heart is an old heart ſtill, there is no newneſs, becauſe no change. Newneſs of heart peremptorily implies a change of the heart; therefore it is (in Scripture) called <hi>a new birth;</hi> (Joh 3. 3. <hi>Except a man be born again.)</hi> And a <hi>quickning from the dead;</hi> (Luke 15. 24 <hi>This my ſon was dead, and is alive again.)</hi> And a <hi>turning from darkeneſs to light;</hi> (Act. 26. 18. <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan unto God.)</hi> And a <hi>transformation;</hi> (Rom. 12. 2. <hi>Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.)</hi> And a <hi>tranſlation;</hi> (2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>Old things are paſt away, all things are become new.)</hi> And a <hi>waſhing,</hi> and a <hi>cleanſing,</hi> and a <hi>refining;</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 7. 1. Mal. 3. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When the heart is made new, there is a <hi>great and eminent change</hi> made <note place="margin">It is an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent change.</note> in it: There are three great changes of mans heart.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. One <hi>was by ſin;</hi> when <hi>man being in honour abode not,</hi> but fell by tranſgreſſion, and <hi>became like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> This was a wofull change, like that of the apoſtatizing Angels from heaven to hell.</item>

                     <p>The change which makes newneſs of heart is a great and eminent change, reckoned therefore amongſt the wonders of God, called a <hi>Creation,</hi> and a <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> and the <hi>opening of the eyes of the blind,</hi> and <hi>unstopping the ears of the deaf,</hi> Iſa. 35. 5. And looſing the tongue of the dumb. It is ſuch a change that others beholding it, ſtand amazed at, as they did when they ſaw <hi>Paul</hi> appear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> from what he was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 19. 21. Yea the very Angels are affected with it, and rejoyce: <hi>I ſay unto you there is joy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> Luke 15. 10. I call it an eminent and great change, becauſe it ſurpaſſeth all other changes which may be found in men who yet have no newneſs of heart.</p>

Newneſs of life doth principally reſpect the root and ſpring The work of renewing grace begins where ſin begins; it begins the Reformation where ſin begins the deformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it begins to change and cleanſe where ſin begins to corrupt, and defile, and that is in the ſoul: Outward Reformation is one thing, and inward Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is another thing: The <hi>Phariſees made clean the outſide of the cup,</hi> and they were <hi>painted Sepulchres,</hi> which <hi>within were full of rotten bones. Hypocriſie</hi> can make a new garbe of viſible actions, but it can never make an new heart; it never changes and alters the ſoul; that ſtill remains under the love and power of ſin: But when the heart is made new, there is ſome inward work of grace by which the ſoul is changed from death to life, from unholineſs to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a change in <hi>the whole ſoul;</hi> when the heart is made new, all the ſoul <note place="margin">In the whole ſoule.</note> is divinely changed: Therefore this newneſs or Renewingneſs is compared to the <hi>light</hi> which diſperſeth itſelf into the whole body of the Aire, ſo that there is not any one part of the Aire which is not enlightned: To the <hi>oyntment</hi> which fills the whole room with ſweet Odour: To <hi>leaven,</hi> which diffuſeth itſelf over the whole lump. As it is with <hi>Original ſin,</hi> it is an univerſal defilement, it infects all the ſoul, there is not one faculty of the ſoul but it is defiled by it: So it is with Renewing grace, or newneſs of heart, it is an univerſal alteration or change; it alters all the ſoul, and all the faculties of the ſoul; when a new heart is given, there is a change made.</p>

Nay, look on them diſtinctly in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion.

                     <p>Fourthly, This <hi>change</hi> (which conſtitutes newneſs of heart) is <hi>wrought</hi> by <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> Therefore our Sanctification (which is the ſame with the giving <note place="margin">A change wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt.</note> of a new heart) is called the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 1.

                     <p n="2">2.

                        <hi>for them,</hi> and which was the very deſign of his death: Now Jeſus Chriſt did by his death make a threefold purchaſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Perſons</hi> of all the Elect; he bought them with a price: <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 19. 20.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of all the <hi>Services</hi> of the Elect: <hi>He hath delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, that we might ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs,</hi> Luk. 1. 74, 75. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Lord doth put ſeveral duties and ſervices upon his people,</hi> which <note place="margin">God hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſervices for his people.</note> are impoſſible for them to perform, unleſs he did give them a new heart, an heart changed and renewed by grace.

                     <p>And <hi>Chriſt is their head, and they are his body,</hi> this is another relation, <hi>(Coloſ.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>He is the head of the body, the Church)</hi> Now is Chriſt the head of profane and ungodly men?

Certainly as all who come from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> do bear his image, ſo all who are of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> do bear his image. <hi>Ergo.</hi> They muſt be a redeemed and ſanctified people.</p>

                        <p>But now give me leave to ſay two things unto this.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Civil Righteouſneſs is good,</hi> and ſo is external profeſſion of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; <note place="margin">Civil righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is good.</note> God requires that and this: <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>All things whatſoever you would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Mich. 6. 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> To do juſtly is one of the things required.

And we muſt <hi>hold forth the word of life,</hi> Phil. 2. 16.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Nevertheleſs, <hi>newneſſe of heart</hi> (or renewing grace) <hi>is a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Yet newneſs of heart is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it.</note> 
                           <hi>quality from their</hi> civil Righteouſneſs; and one may be civilly righteous, and honeſt, who never had his heart renewed by grace, nay whoſe heart doth extreamly loath and oppoſe it.</p>
                        <p>Now civil righteouſneſs, and heavenly newneſs of heart doth differ in ſix <note place="margin">They differ in ſix things.</note> things.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Civil Righteouſneſs is of a low and inferiour birth or original;</hi> there are <note place="margin">Civil righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is of an inferiour birth.</note> three things which may be ſufficient to make a man civilly righteous.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One is the <hi>light of nature,</hi> which hath ſome notions and principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity and honeſty.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſecond is the <hi>power of edification;</hi> Parents and Tutors may ſo repreſent the honor of juſt dealing, and the forbid unworthineſs of unrighteous dealing, that young and tender natures may take in a ſavour, and taſte of them all their dayes, though they never act upon any knowledge that God enjoyns them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third is the <hi>influence of example,</hi> beholding ſuch a courſe and way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in Parents, and Superiours, in Friends, whoſe examples we are ready to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, becauſe their perſons we do love and reverence. But newneſs of heart, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace is wrought by a higher hand than the dictates of nature, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of friends, or examples of men; it is the birth of the Spirit of God (every regenerate or renewed perſon is born of the Spirit) the immediate power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is put forth in the creating of a new heart.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Civil Righteouſneſs either totally confines us to the duties of the ſecond</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Civil Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.</note> 
                           <hi>Table</hi> (as if we had none to eye and pleaſe but our neighbour) or if it gives way to the duties of the firſt Table, it is but to <hi>a formal and ſuperficial obſervance.</hi> The civil righteous man though he is ſtrict in duties to man, yet is irreligious in all his religious performances: He ſaith a Prayer, but he knows not how to pray in the Spirit, and with Faith; and he hears a Sermon, but it is as if he heard it not, ſleeping and waking, with running and roving diſtracted thoughts on the world; he talks of a Sabbath, but he knowes not how to keep a Sabbath, and is weary of it, and counts the ſtrict obſervance of it a Jewiſh burden: But renewing grace
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:55323:269"/>
brings in the heart to all the will of God, it enables to give unto <hi>Caeſar the things that are Caeſars,</hi> and <hi>unto God the things that are Gods;</hi> to be righteous with good men, and to be upright with God, to ſerve him with love and fear.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Civil Righteouſneſs</hi> may look <hi>at ſome outward, eaſie, ordinary actions of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">It looks only at outward eaſie duties.</note> 
                           <hi>Religion,</hi> but it leaves the heart deſtitute of the great inward actings of Religion. When did you ever ſee a perſon only civilly righteous lay the Axe to the root of the tree? ſearching of his heart, and judging the corruptions of his heart, and humbly mourning and lamenting under the ſence of his wicked heart, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after Jeſus Chriſt, and importunately wreſtling for grace and mercy, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to crucifie the luſts of his heart. He is ſo farre from theſe, that he thinks them either ſuperfluous, or impoſſible. But renewing grace doth chiefly act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart, there it ſets up the Throne, and gives the Law, and exerciſeth Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Rule, &amp;c.</p>

although he forbears any viſible acts of ſin, yet his heart is as wicked as ever, and his ſinful inclinations and affections the ſame as before: But this it is not when the heart is renewed by grace; for renewing grace is not only a cord to with-hold, but it is likewiſe a plaiſter to heal and change, as it is a preſervative againſt ſinful acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and works, ſo it is a ſpiritual ſalve to cure our ſinful natures; the renewed Chriſtian doth not only forbear ſin, but he doth alſo hate ſin; a reſtrained ſinner at ſometimes cannot ſin; a renewed ſinner at no time would ſin: the one doth not commit the ſin which yet he ſtill loves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the other doth ſometimes do the ſin which yet his ſoul ſtill hates.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>A man may attain to all theſe, and yet be a very notorious wicked man:</hi> Moſt of theſe did <hi>Herod</hi> attain unto (if not unto all of them) yet the man <note place="margin">A man may have theſe, and remain wicked.</note> was very vile and wicked; and three things did manifeſtly declare him to be ſo; 1. <hi>He kept Herodias his brothers wife,</hi> Mar. 6. 17. 2ly <hi>He took away the life of John the Baptiſt,</hi> Mar. 6. 27. 3ly <hi>He ſet Jeſus Chriſt at naught,</hi> and rejected him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 11.

troubled ſinner it is <hi>ſelf-love;</hi> a poor wretch now plainly ſees that he muſt be damned if he doth not leave and change his ſinful courſe; and if he ſlights Chriſt and holy duties, as formerly he hath done, there is in him (in this condition) an horrible fear of death, and of Gods eternal vengeance, and he would not fall into the conſuining fire; (no creature likes its own deſtruction, much leſs an eternal damnation) and therefore this troubled ſinner will ſet upon duties, and will make much moan for Chriſt, and all that moves him unto this, is his ſelf-love, he loves his life, and he loves his ſafety; but yet all this while doth not love Chriſt for Chriſt, nor holy Duties as ways to glorifie God; but where renewing grace is in a man, the principle which ſets him a work for Chriſt, is faith, and which draws him out, is a love of godlineſs, and a love of the glory of God, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>In the end</hi> or aim, which in works done upon the ſole account of <note place="margin">In the end.</note> a troubling conſcience, is only ſelf-eaſe and quietneſs, and calmneſs of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the diſtemper lies only in trouble, ſo the remedy lies only in eaſe. Oh if the wrath of God were off in the feeling of it; but the poor wretch doth not think of removing the wrath of God in the ſtate of it; and O if the painful ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of conſcience were off, that and this he aims at directly; if he thinks of Chriſt, if he prays, if he hears, if he confers, if he reforms, all tends to this, <hi>viz.</hi> the removing of ſenſible evil, of penal evil, of terrors and troubles, and that his conſcience may be quiet, and hold its peace, and ſpeak bitterly no more unto him; but where the heart is renewed by grace, the conſcience ſhould trouble, yet it is not that only, nor that principally which the perſon looks at to be removed; but it is the cauſe of that trouble; O Lord, take away iniquity; O Lord, heal my ſoul; O Lord, ſubdue my ſin; O be thou my ſanctifying God as well as my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning God; my ſins trouble my ſoul, O let me no more trouble thee by my ſins, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, To whomſoever God doth give a new heart, unto him he doth give <hi>a</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A new ſight and feeling.</note> 
                        <hi>new ſight and feeling of their ſpiritual condition;</hi> before the Lord renews the heart by grace, there were two qualities predominant in it.</p>
                     <p>One was <hi>ignorance</hi> or blindneſs; an unregenerate man is a dead man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. and an ignorant man, he underſtands not, he knows not what he is, nor what he doth, nor what his condition of ſoul is: <hi>We were never in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> ſaid they in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>The way of wickedneſs is as darkneſs, they know not at what they ſtumble,</hi> ſaid <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4. 19.</p>
                     <p>Another was <hi>hardneſs</hi> and unſenſibleneſs; a wicked man hath a wicked heart, but he is not ſenſible of it; and his heart is deſperately wicked, but he is not ſenſible of it: He is ignorant and proud, and impenitent, and malicious, and ſerving divers luſts, and under the curſe and wrath of God, but he is not ſenſible of it: His ſin abounds in heart and life, and rules, and bears ſway, and he is a ſlave unto them, but he is not ſenſible of this; but when the Lord renews the heart by grace, there is (preſently) a ſpiritual life, and preſently a ſpiritual ſenſe; the man ſees that in himſelf, which he never ſaw before, and experimentally feels that in himſelf which he never felt before: Alas ſaith he, What a wretched creature am I? and what a ſinful heart is here? full of wickedneſs, deſperately evil; here is no good dwelling in me; here is that ſinfulneſs abounding in me; here is that ignorant, vain, worldly, ſtubborn, ſenſual, rebellious, unbelieving, hardened heart, of which the Lord ſpeaks, and which the Lord threatens, and the man groans under this burden of his ſinful heart and life: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4. and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complains of it: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. and now loaths himſelf in his own eyes: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. and bewails his condition with trouble of heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To whomſoever the Lord gives a new heart, he doth give unto <note place="margin">A new judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> them <hi>a new judgement and opinion;</hi> before the Lord renews a mans heart, he hath a corrupt and falſe judgement:</p>
                     <p>Partly <hi>of himſelf,</hi> in reſpect</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Of his eſtate;</hi> that he is alive, that he is righteous, that he needs no Repentance, that he ſtands in need of nothing.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Of his own ways;</hi> that they are the wiſeſt for ſafety, and beſt for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and profit.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Partly <hi>of Gods commands and ways;</hi> that of all other they are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and moſt burdenſome, and moſt undelightful, and for the moſt part need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; what needs a man to trouble himſelf ſo much for his ſins, and what needs a man preſently to ſet upon the practice of Repentance, and what needs a man to
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:55323:272"/>
make ſo ſure of Chriſt and mercy, and grace, and heaven: But when the Lord gives a man a new heart, his judgement is rectified, and he hath now another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than formerly he had, his judgement is divers from what it was, in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of himſelf and his ways.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpake, <hi>I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed,</hi> Rom. 7. So before renewing grace came into the heart, a man thinks high thoughts of himſelf, and of his ways; but when that comes, then he judgeth of himſelf as he is, and of his ways as indeed they are, and have been. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>To ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief;</hi> and for <hi>his wayes,</hi> he now looks on them as ways of death, and paths of hell, in which who ſo walks, ſhall find no reſt nor peace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In reſpect of God</hi> and his ways: God is now look't upon as an only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and could I enjoy him for my God in Chriſt, I were bleſſed for ever; and his ways are righteous, and good, and holy, and moſt pleaſant, and only ſafe; the way of Repentance, the way of faith, the way of holineſs, the way of a godly Converſation; how excellent, how beautiful, how deſirable are all of them to an heart renewed by grace, which yet in former times were judged with ſcorn and contempt, and hatred.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Where the Lord gives a new heart, there he gives <hi>new cares and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">New cares and requeſts.</note> 
                        <hi>requeſts:</hi> Before the Lord renews the heart by grace, a ſinner is very careful, and very careleſs.</p>
                     <p>He is very <hi>careful</hi> for two things.</p>
                     <p>One is <hi>for the world; What ſhall I eat? and what ſhall I drink? and wherewith ſhall I be cloathed?</hi> Matth. 6. His heart is ſet on the world, and <hi>he minds earthly things, and his heart goes after his covetouſneſs, and who will ſhew us any good?</hi> his affections are ſet on things below.</p>
                     <p>The other is for <hi>his fleſhly luſts: They that are after the fleſh, minde the things of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 5. <hi>And they make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. 14. But he is very <hi>careleſs</hi> about his ſoul, therefore he is ſaid to <hi>deſpiſe his ſoul,</hi> and not to <hi>know the day of his viſitation, nor the things which concern his peace,</hi> and to make light of the invitations of Chriſt. But when the Lord begins to renew the heart by grace, there are new cares and new deſires: O how the ſoul is taken with the ſoul, and for the ſoul: Lord, What will become of my poor ſoul? and what ſhall I do for my poor ſoul? if I get not Chriſt, my ſoul is loſt; and if I get not mercy, I am undone: Take the world who will, and take ſinful pleaſures who will, but O Lord be merciful to me a ſinner, and O Lord be thou reconciled to my ſoul, and lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me: Every new heart hath new thoughts, and cares, and deſires: <hi>What ſhall we do,</hi> ſaid they to <hi>John the Baptiſt?</hi> Matth. 3. And <hi>What ſhall we do,</hi> ſaid they to <hi>Peter?</hi> Acts 2. 37. And <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas?</hi> Acts 16. 30.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If a new heart be given, there will then be found in you the preſence <note place="margin">New princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> of all <hi>new principles,</hi> which are contrary to all the old principles in the old ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart; there is not any one ſpiritual and heavenly principle reſpecting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they may be found in you; <hi>v. g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that is one principle of an old heart, the contrary unto it; <hi>viz. Knowledge</hi> is given when you come to partake of a new heart. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge.</hi> Eph. 5. 8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs,</hi> but <hi>now are ye light in the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Carnal wiſdome,</hi> that is another principle of the old heart; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto that, is given to a perſon when God renews his heart; <hi>viz. Spiritual and heavenly wiſdom,</hi> a wiſdom for ſalvation. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>A wiſdom unto that which is good.</hi> Rom. 16. 9. <hi>A wiſdom to approve the things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi>

Phil. 1. 10. <hi>A wiſdome to know the times or ſeaſons</hi> of grace, and to imbrace and improve them: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Vanity of ſpirit,</hi> that is another old principle in the old heart; an old heart is a vain heart, and an old mind is a vain mind; but when the Lord gives a new heart, he then gives a <hi>spiritual ſeriouſneſs</hi> unto the heart, <hi>To work out its ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. <hi>And to ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear,</hi> Hebr. 12. 28. <hi>And to give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. <hi>And taking heed of neglecting ſo great ſalvation,</hi> Hebr. 2. 1, 3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Hardneſs,</hi> this is another principle in an old heart; the heart is a <hi>ſtony heart,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. and an <hi>heart of Adamant,</hi> Zach. 7. 11, 12. But when God gives a new heart, there is a principle contrary unto this put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, namely a <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>mournful</hi> heart. <hi>Joſiah</hi> had a tender heart, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27. <hi>God maketh my heart ſoft,</hi> Job 23. 16. <hi>They ſhall mourn, as one mourneth for his only ſon,</hi> Zach. 12. 10</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Pride,</hi> this is another old principle of the old heart. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 22. ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 6. <hi>Pride compaſſeth them about as with a chain:</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 29. <hi>We have heard the pride of Moab,</hi> (he is exceeding proud) <hi>his loftineſs, his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtineſs of his heart:</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, proud boaſters:</hi> But when the Lord gives a new heart, there is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>humility</hi> given, which is contrary unto that pride of heart. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. <hi>All his Saints are in thine hand, they ſit down at thy feet, every one ſhall receive of thy words.</hi> Pſal. 131. 1. <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>Surely I have behaved and quieted my ſelf as a childe that is weaned of his mother, my ſoul is even as a weaned childe.</hi> Acts 20. 19. <hi>Serving the Lord with all humility of minde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Stubbornneſs of reſiſtance and unyieldingneſs,</hi> this is another principle of an old heart, an old heart is a ſtubborn heart; as <hi>for the Word which thou haſt ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee,</hi> ſaid they to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 44. 16. <hi>Ye always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, ye ſtiffe-necked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>Stephen</hi> unto them in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51.

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> That there are ſuch combates and conflicts in unregenerate men, I grant; <note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts in a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man. In their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> but then they are of another nature, different from thoſe in a renewed or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In their <hi>Principles:</hi> The conflict in the one ariſeth from <hi>ſervile fear;</hi> the conflict in the other ariſeth from <hi>ſpiritual hatred.</hi> A natural Conſcience may ſee the danger of ſinning, and thereupon oppoſe the affections inclining to ſin; but a renewed heart ſees the baſeneſs of ſin, and thereupon inclines the heart to hate it: As ſin a coal of fire, there is the fire which burneth, and there is the coal which defileth; ſo in ſin, there is conſiderable, the wrath unto which it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the filthineſs whereby it doth pollute the ſoul: The fear of burning wrath, this makes the unregenerate conſcience to hold off, and to argue againſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſin: but it is the defilement and pollution by ſin which makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart to abhor and conteſt with it: Not only or principally the evil by ſin, but the evil of ſin which is ſo extreamly contrary to God in his Nature, and Will, and Glory, which we entirely love, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">In the Seat.</note> Secondly, In <hi>the Seate</hi> and place of combate; <label type="milestone">

                        </label> The combate in unregenerate men, is like that between Souldiers in ſeveral Forts; and that in renewed perſons is like the fight of Souldiers in the ſame Fort where every ones ſword is againſt every one: The conflict or combate in the unregenerate, is only 'twixt one faculty and another diſtinct faculty; the affections go one way, and the judgement and conſcience another way: But when a mans heart is renewed by grace, there now ariſeth a war and combate within every faculty: The judgment is divided againſt the judgment; and the will is divided againſt the will; and the affection againſt the affection: The reaſon whereof is this; becauſe there is fleſh and Spirit, ſin and grace co-exiſtent, and co-habiting in every faculty of the ſoul; ſin is not driven up to one faculty, whilſt grace poſſeſſeth the other faculties: but renewing grace is in every faculty; and remaining corruption is alſo in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faculty: <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Thirdly, In the <hi>Extent</hi> of the combate; that in unregenerate perſons is only with ſome groſs, ſcandalous, and infamous ſins; but for ſecret ſins, or other <note place="margin">In the Exte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:55323:273"/>
by grace, there the combate is againſt all known ſin, the reaſon whereof is this, becauſe the ground of oppoſition is not accidental and particular, but natural and univerſal: the newneſs of the heart is not an humour, but a contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that of ſin, and therefore the heat doth conflict with all that is cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is naturally contrary unto it; ſo doth renewing grace combate with all ſin, becauſe it is a nature contrary to ſin as ſin; not as little or great, ſecret, or open, &amp;c. but as ſin.</p>
                     <p>4. In <hi>the event:</hi> In regenerate men the iſſue of the conflict is either a plain giving up to the will of luſt in the affections (the man being tyred and <note place="margin">In the event.</note> vexed with the violent ſollicitations of them, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was with <hi>Dalilahs</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities) or in caſe that natural conſcience doth prevail, it is not to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of any ſin, but only to a temporary repreſſing and reſtraining of ſin; but the combate ends otherwiſe where the heart is renewed by grace; for it makes a more conſtant and reſolute reſiſtance, and at the laſt (though perhaps after ſome foiles) it gets the victory over ſin, and wins the field: Thus you ſee that the new ſpiritual combate or conflict, is a true character of a heart indeed renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace: It is not a ſign of true grace that a man hath no ſin, but that his heart is conflicting with all ſin,</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Whenſoever a new heart is given by God unto any perſon, then are <note place="margin">New abilities.</note> there given <hi>new abilities</hi> unto that perſon.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, two things I take for granted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>renewing grace is in itſelf a very powerful quality:</hi> There is a Spirit of power and might in it, and going along with it; if it were not ſo, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change the heart of a ſinner, nor unthrown ſin, nor maintain conflict with all the powers of ſin and Satan; nor ſend out ſuch high works of ſervices as it doth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it doth <hi>conferre an ability or power on the ſoule;</hi> to what end elſe is it given unto us, if by it we have no more power than what we had before in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural condition? When we are renewed by grace, we are ſaid to be <hi>quickned who were dead;</hi> which neceſſarily implies that there is a power imprinted in us when we are renewed.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a two-fold power given when renewing grace is given.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. One is to do ſuch things which no natural or unregenerate perſon ever did, or could do.</item>
                        <item>2. Another is to do ſuch things which we our ſelves were not able to do, before God did renew our hearts by grace.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, take me the braveſt Heathen that ever was, or the moſt accompliſhed Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite that ever was, and conſider what they have done, how far they have gone; if you are not able to go beyond them in doing ſome things which they could not riſe unto, aſſuredly your hearts were never renewed by grace: As Chriſt ſpake, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. 20. So ſay I, except you be able to do more than the choiſeſt Heathen, or exquiſite Hypocrite, or any unregenerate perſon in the world, your hearts were never changed by renewing grace.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Will ſome ſay unto me, what do you mean, for many unregenerate men have gone very farre, and ſo high, that it is a queſtion whether ſome of the people of God have riſen ſo high?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, Let them go as farre as unregenerate men may or can go; yet every regenerate or renewed perſon goes farre beyond them, and the demonſtration of it is this: renewing grace is the higheſt elevation and perfection of mans nature; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts (with which alone unregenerate men are poſſeſſed) are farre below, and behind it in excellency, and abilities.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But plainly to open my mind unto you; there are ſix things unto which renewing grace doth enable a man, and unto which no unregenerate perſon could ever attain.</p>
                     <list>
                        <pb n="516" facs="tcp:55323:274"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>Self-denial</hi> in a mans opinion and affections, and worth, and ways, and ends.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Sincere love of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of all that do belong to Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>A cordial compliance</hi> with the whole revealed will of God.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>A ſubmiſſion of the whole heart</hi> to Chriſt in all his offices, and with all his conditions.</item>
                        <item>5. <hi>An unfeigned hatred of every ſin.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. <hi>To live by faith</hi> upon the promiſes of God in all the contingencies and occurrences of the world. No unregenerate perſon ever did or could (in that eſtate) riſe unto any one of theſe things, and every renewed perſon doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto them in the truth of them; therefore if you find a power to do thoſe things, aſſuredly your hearts are renewed by grace.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Secondly, Moreover, you may diſcern the preſence of renewing grace, by that power and ability to do ſuch works as you your ſelves were never able to do before. Heretofore you were not able to ſhed a tear for ſin, to forſake any one beloved ſin, to ſend up an affectionate prayer to God, to prize Chriſt above all, and to thirſt after him; to take any delight in God, to ſuffer any reproach for Chriſt: But now ye are able to mourn for your ſins, and to abhor them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds.</hi> To forſake the deareſt luſts, and to cry mightily to God, and to take delight in him, and in his will and ways, and to prize Chriſt above all, and to hunger and thirſt after him as the only chiefeſt good and happineſs, and you can do for Chriſt, and you can ſuffer for Chriſt, &amp;c. Do you find it thus with you? then are your hearts renewed by grace.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, You may know whether God hath given a new heart, by the <note place="margin">By new works.</note> 
                        <hi>new works,</hi> and the new means of working: We ſay, that <hi>ut res ſe habent in eſſendo, ſic ſe habent in operando:</hi> All works and operations are anſwerable to the nature in us; the old nature finds out old works, and the new nature finds out new works. Before the <hi>Prophet healed and ſeaſoned the ſpring of water,</hi> it did ſend out bitter and unwholſome water, but afterward the <hi>waters</hi> (the ſpring being healed) <hi>were ſweet and wholſome,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 21, 22. So before the Lord doth heal our old hearts, the works flowing from them are bitter, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, vile, abominable, <hi>(that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3.) but when he heals the heart by renewing grace, there are new works of holineſs and righteouſneſs anſwerable to a renewed heart, <hi>(whatſoever is born of the Spirit is Spirit.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then take a ſurvay of your former Works, and of your former Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and compare them with the preſent works and courſe of life, and be your ſelves the Judges what newneſs you find in them. Have you left your former works of uncleanneſs, of drunkenneſs, of profaning the Sabbath, of ſcoffing at holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of miſpending your precious time in gamings, and in vain pleaſures: Are you not ſtill to be found in the ſame paths and ways, and works of wickedneſs? Are there not ſtill the ſame fruits growing out of the old root? and the ſame ſtream flowing out of the ſame corrupt ſpring? How can ye ſay that you have new hearts, when ſtill you live old lives, and go on in the old courſe of ſin? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this is moſt true, that a new life ever attends a new heart; if the heart be changed, the life will be changed; newneſs of heart will appear in newneſs of Converſation. Did <hi>Paul,</hi> did <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> did <hi>Zacheus,</hi> did any (of whoſe Converſion you read in Scripture) lead ſuch lives as formerly? Did they <hi>not put off concerning the former Converſation, the Old man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt according to the deceitful lusts?</hi> Eph. 4. 22. <hi>Have they not had their fruit unto holineſs?</hi> Rom. 6. 22. Therefore let no man deceive himſelf, ſaying,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:55323:274"/>
though I walk as in former times, and live ſtill as I have lived, yet my heart is as good as the beſt; thou doſt but delude and deſtroy thy ſelf in this vain boaſting, for the Tree is known by his fruits; it is impoſſible that thy heart ſhould be a new heart, as long as thy Converſation remains a wicked Converſation.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But you may ſay, Do you not ſee that hypocrites do appear in good works, and yet they are wicked perſons; and good men ſometimes appear in evil works and actions, and yet they are not wicked:</hi> Ergo. <hi>This appearance in new works cannot be a ſure ſign of a new heart:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Whatſoever the good works may be which a wicked man may do, I ſhall not at this time diſpute; but this may ſuffice you, that where there is no new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, there is no newneſs of heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is not this or that particular paſſage in the life which denominatively declares the eſtate of the heart either way; one particular good action may be done by him whoſe heart is naught; and one particular ill action may be done by him whoſe heart is good, and truly renewed by grace. As the new heart brings forth new works, ſo it doth act them after a new manner of working; it is poſſible that an unregenerate man may do many works which are morally good, but then he doth not perform thoſe works in ſuch a manner as that man doth, whoſe heart is renewed by grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of works for the manner in a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</note> There are four qualifications as to the manner of working, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duties which are found in the renewed perſon, and in no other man.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He performs them in the ſtrength of Chriſt,</hi> by vertue of union and communion with him, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> as the members of the body do act by vertue of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and communion with the head: <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul) through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. <hi>And as the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me,</hi> Joh. 15. 4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He performs them as with <hi>love; the love of Chriſt conſtraineth me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my Word,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. Now when a man doth works of obedience out of love, he is ready and willing to do them; the work is written in his heart, he takes delight in the doing of them: <hi>I delight to do thy Will O God,</hi> Pſal. 40. 8. <hi>And make me to go in the paths of thy Commandments, for therein do I delight,</hi> Pſal. 119. 35. It is a mans <hi>meat and drink to do the will of God,</hi> Joh. 4. 34. <hi>The yoke is eaſie,</hi> and the <hi>Commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He performs them with <hi>fervency of ſpirit,</hi> not coldly, and careleſly, and indifferently, but cloſely, and ſeriouſly, with a fervent ſpirit. <hi>(Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord)</hi> he ſeeks the Lord with his whole heart; an heavenly <hi>impetus &amp; aeſtus, &amp; vigor, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. He performs them with <hi>integrity of intention;</hi> looks not at himſelf, but the glory of God in Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, You may know that God hath given you a new heart, if you find <note place="margin">New delights and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                        <hi>new delights and ſatisfactions.</hi> There is not a man in the world but the frame of his heart may be known by that which he takes delight, and contentment, and ſatisfaction in. If one hath a proud heart, the vanities, and faſhions, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and braveries of the world are his delight and ſatisfaction. If one hath an ambitious heart, the honours and applauſes, and dignities, and preferments, and powers of the world are his delight and ſatisfaction. If one hath a covetous heart, the riches and profits, and treaſures of the world are his delight and ſatisfaction. If one hath a ſenſual and unclean heart, the filthineſs and actings of luſts are his delight and ſatisfaction: And there is no unregenerate perſon, but either ſome worldly object, or ſome ſinful object is his delight and ſatisfaction; might he have
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:55323:275"/>
wealth enough, or honour enough, or pleaſure enough, he would deſire no more, here he would reſt, and with this he would be contented and ſatisfied: But now when the Lord changeth and reneweth the heart by grace, that which delights and contents, and ſatisfies other men, will not delight and ſatisfie him; nay, thoſe very objects which formerly ſatisfied himſelf, will not now by any means ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him; but he hath new objects, and new ways of delight and ſatisfaction: If the Lord ſhould ſay unto a regenerate and renewed perſon, I will give thee all the world, this would not ſatisfie him or delight him, though heretofore a little of it would have gone far, and have done much. The renewed perſon ſees what a vanity of vanities the world is, and what a hell of hells ſin is; and his delights and ſatisfactions are now in objects ſutable to his new nature, the higheſt and beſt objects, theſe are ſutable with the higheſt and beſt heart. A God, a reconciled God, the favour of God, the knowledge of him as ſo, the fruition of him as ſo, the meditations on him as ſo, the communions with him as ſo, the manifeſtations of him to the ſoul as ſo, the hopes of the future and eternal enjoyment of him as ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. Theſe, theſe are the delights, the contentments and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an heart (indeed) renewed by grace. The excellent glories of Chriſt, a near relation unto Chriſt, the life of Chriſt, the peace by Chriſt, the comforts of Chriſt, the enjoyments of and by Chriſt, the love of Chriſt, the powers of Chriſt, the preſence of Chriſt, and fellowſhip with Chriſt, theſe are the new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, the new contentments, and the only ſatisfactions of a new heart; theſe are food and rayment, theſe are houſes and lands, theſe are parents and friends, theſe are treaſures and pleaſures to a renewed heart; theſe are the reſt of it, and the heaven to it; one ſight of God in Chriſt, one ſmile of his love, one word of peace and joy from Chriſt, delights and ſatisfies a renewed heart more than all which the world can afford.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Another ſign of a new heart, is <hi>new ſociety;</hi> when God gives a <note place="margin">A new ſociety.</note> man a new heart, that man hath a new Maſter, and new work, and new friends, and ſociety. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 14. <hi>What fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> Pſal. 139. 21. <hi>Do not I hate them O Lord that hate thee?</hi> O what a burden is it to a good heart to be in ungodly company? <hi>Woe is me that I ſo journ in Meſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar,</hi> Pſal. 120. 5.

                     <p>Tenthly, Laſtly, When God gives a man a new heart, he doth preſently <note place="margin">A new rule.</note> ſet up a <hi>new rule of life</hi> to walk by; and according to that is his courſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the days of his life; and what is that rule? not our own judgement, not revelations, not our own will, not our own luſts, not our own affections, not the opinion of men, not the cuſtomes of the world, not the applauſes of the world, not the ways of worldly advancements and advantages: But the rule which a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart ſets up to guide and preſcribe him, is none other but that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſets up for his people to walk by, and that is his <hi>written Word.</hi> Pſal. 119. 105. <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</hi> Ver. 133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy Word.</hi> This rule he ſets up for all matters of faith, and for all matters of fact; this I muſt believe, becauſe God reveals it and commands me to believe it; this I receive for truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe God delivers it for truth; and that I reject as erroneous, becauſe the Word of God condemns it as
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:55323:275"/>
contrary to the truth: And this work I do, and that way I walk in, becauſe God ſets it out in his Word for me; and that I do not do, and ſo and ſo I dare not walk, for I have no Word of God for it; nay, the Word of God is againſt it; why? mans heart is right indeed, it is renewed by grace; but if a man will walk contrary to this rule, if he will not ſpeak and live, according to this Word, it is becauſe <hi>there is no light in him,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20.</p>

                     <p>There are ſix things which do concern the ſoul as nearly I think as any can, and of every one of them is renewing grace a ſure teſtimony. 1. The love of God. 2.

                        <note place="margin">It is an effect of our union with Chriſt.</note> Is it no comfort to you that you belong to Chriſt, that Chriſt is yours, that you are in him of a truth! hear what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man he in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> Beloved, this is moſt certain, that <hi>unction</hi> flows from <hi>union;</hi> you are not firſt ſanctified and renewed, and then brought into Chriſt; but you are firſt brought into Chriſt, and ſo are you ſanctified and renewed by the Spirit of Chriſt, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:55323:276"/>
of him, you do partake of life; none have their hearts renewed by grace, but ſuch as are in Chriſt; and all that are in Chriſt have their hearts renewed by grace: Joh. 1. 16. <hi>Of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Newneſs of heart is the <hi>nobleſt and higheſt elevation of our hearts,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt elevation of our hearts.</note> As the degenerate and corrupt nature is of all other the worſt and baſeſt (for there is nothing more vile than that which is moſt ſinful) ſo the renewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is directly oppoſite unto it, is of all other the moſt excellent and raiſing; it is therefore called, <hi>the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>The image of God,</hi> Col. 3. 10. <hi>The image of his glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which may convince any Chriſtian, that renewing grace or newneſs of heart is our higheſt elevation and perfection.</p>
                     <p>1. One, becauſe it is the <hi>nearest reſemblance of that nature</hi> which is in God himſelf; when you are renewed by grace, then you are like unto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: 1 Pet. 1. 16 <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Another, becauſe it is the <hi>choiſeſt work</hi> or <hi>effect of the Spirit of God,</hi> who though he produceth many other works, yet this is the chiefeſt of them, herein is his Arm revealed; and in this doth his glory moſt appear, and ſhine.</p>
                     <p>3. A third is, becauſe it is our <hi>neareſt conformity to Christ</hi> our Head, in whom the image of God doth moſt appear. The image of God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>in knowledge, holineſs, and righteouſneſs,</hi> as you may ſee if you compare <hi>Col.</hi> 3. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and this image was perfect in Chriſt who was the image of his Father; and unto this are we conformed (in our proportion) when we are renewed by grace; for we are then <hi>changed into the ſame image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3 18. And upon this one account are they ſaid to <hi>be one Spirit with him who are joyned with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Newneſs of heart <hi>enables you for all heavenly communion, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It enables for heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> 
                        <hi>to Divine glory.</hi> Now you may aproach, and come near, and ſtand in the preſence of your God, and he will take delight in you, and impart himſelf unto you; when you call, he will anſwer you, and ſay, Here I am; and when you hear his Word, he will meet you, and teach, and guide, and rejoyce your heart. When God renews our hearts, he doth then ſet us apart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, owns us as his jewels, looks on us as his <hi>Hephziba</hi> and <hi>Beulah,</hi> as his beloved, as ſuch in whom he delights, as his friends, as his favourites; you may open all your wants, and deſires, and conditions unto him, and he will open all his goodneſs, and kindneſs, and mercies unto you: Your hearts are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his temples in which he will dwell, and walk, and appear with glorious manifeſtations of his love, and grace, and help. Beſides this newneſs of heart makes you ſerviceable unto his glory; you can glorifie him in your hearts by believing on him; in your lives by heavenly, upright, humble, obedient faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful walking.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>God will own and accept of it, and the fruit of it, though but little and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God owns and accept of it, though little and weak.</note> 
                        <hi>weak;</hi> As the leaſt degree of newneſs doth denominate the condition, ſo the weakeſt expreſſions of it are accepted; <hi>He will not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> Zach. 4. 10. <hi>The bruiſed reed he will not break, nor will he quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> Matth. 12. 20. <hi>But he will spare his people as a man ſpareth his ſon that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3. 17.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Nay he <hi>will ſtand by it, and uphold it, and ſtrengthen it, and perfect it:</hi> When you are under ſpiritual conflicts with your corruptions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">He will ſtand by it.</note> he will be preſent with you; he will put forth his ſtrong hand upon your weak hand; he will make his power to appear in your weakneſs, he will ſtrengthen what he hath wrought, and finiſh what he hath begun.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="522" facs="tcp:55323:277"/>
Seventhly, <hi>Certain bleſſings, and ſpecial cares are for all whoſe hearts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by grace:</hi> No people on earth have ſuch a title to earth, nor ſuch a <note place="margin">Special bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

The Lord is near unto them, he is round about them, he is in the midſt of them, he will do them good, he will ſurely bleſs them, no good thing ſhall be wanting to them, he will never leave them nor forſake them, he will be a preſent help unto them in the time of trouble, he will know their ſouls in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and will contend againſt all who do contend againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Renewing grace will at the laſt bring you to the enjoyment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It will bring us to eternal happineſs.</note>

                     <p>1. <hi>The Motives</hi> to perſwade us to look and ſtrive after this new heart. <note place="margin">Motives.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are theſe three. 1. The miſery of an old heart. 2. The neceſſity of a new heart. 3. The poſſibility to be delivered from that, and to be poſſeſſed of this.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The miſery of an old heart:</hi> It is ſuch an heart that (remaining under the power of it) you cannot pleaſe God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Nay, you cannot but displeaſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The miſery of an old heart.</note> 
                        <hi>God,</hi> you cannot but ſtill ſin againſt him, cannot ceaſe from ſin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 14.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly, the old heart,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Is a <hi>fleſhly</hi> and <hi>corrupt heart (the old man which is corrupt,</hi> Eph. 4. 22. It is called the <hi>plague of the heart,</hi> 1 King. 8. 38. It corrupts all your thoughts, and all your affections, and all your ſpeeches, and all your actions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Is an <hi>abominable heart;</hi> the Lord loaths and abhors it, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing of his image, as the workmanſhip of the Divel, as that which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Nature, to his Will, and to his Glory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Is <hi>a debaſing heart;</hi> it makes us more vile than the vileſt of creatures, it makes us like the Divel, it makes us his children, his ſlaves, his captives and bondmen.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A <hi>prejudicing heart,</hi> it keeps us off from God, from Chriſt, from all heavenly communion, from all ability to do good, or to receive good; it holds up our diſtance from mercy, from bleſſings, from heaven, and from all hopes thereof: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Without Chriſt, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It is a <hi>deceitful heart:</hi> Jer. 17. 9. It tempts you, and deceives you; it promiſeth one thing, and payes you another thing; it pretends but to a little more ſinning, and yet it is unſatiable: It tells you that it will bring you off from ſinning, and yet ſtill it engageth you to farther ſinning: It makes you to believe that you ſhall have mercy, and yet it continues you in a courſe of ſinning which
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:55323:277"/>
will loſe you mercy; it ſaith that you ſhall at laſt repent, and yet it makes your heart more hardened and impenitent; it gives you vain pleaſures, and ſo cheats you of all true joy; it feeds you with ſome empty profits, and thereby deprives you of all true riches; it brings in (ſometimes) a little of earth, but then it makes you to loſe Chriſt and your own ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Is <hi>a dreadful heart:</hi> It is the root of gall and wormwood, and the fruits of it are terror, and wrath, and death, and hell. All the terrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpring from it; all the wrath of God breaks out upon you by reaſon of it; all the bitter feelings, and all the dreadful fears and expectations depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; you cannot know peace whiles you live under the power of it: Neither God, nor Chriſt, nor his Spirit, nor his Word, nor Conſcience will ſpeak peace unto you in that condition. But on the contrary, the Law of God threatens and condemns you, and the Goſpel doth as much and more, and God and Conſcience are all in armes againſt you; and every judgement of God (which reſpects your ſoul and body for this life and the next) doth await but one word and commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the juſt God to fall on you, and to torment and deſtroy you.</p>
                     <p>2ly The <hi>neceſſity of a new heart.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The neceſſity of a new heart</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>You know there is a two fold neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>One is <hi>abſolute,</hi> without which a thing cannot be at all, as the union of the ſoul with the body to make a man. Another is <hi>Hypothetical;</hi> if one would be in a well-being, then ſuch or ſuch a thing is neceſſary: Now you can never be in a well-being, unleſs the Lord give you a new heart; renewing grace is neceſſary as to that. Our well-being reſpects either this preſent, or that future life; and newneſs of heart neceſſarily concerns both.</p>
                     <p>1. For <hi>this life;</hi> we cannot be well whiles we are under the curſe for ſin, <note place="margin">For this life</note> and under the power of ſin; to deliver us from the firſt of theſe, it is neceſſary to get Chriſt, and to be juſtified; and to deliver us from the laſt of theſe, it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to get renewing grace, and to be ſanctified.</p>
                     <p>2. For the <hi>future life</hi> of bleſſedneſs, it is alſo neceſſary, foraſmuch as there <note place="margin">For the life to come.</note> cannot be a fruition of that, without an antecedent fruition of this: Joh. 3. 5. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3ly The <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of getting this new heart.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, that though newneſs of heart be neceſſary, yet if it be impoſſible to be <note place="margin">The poſſibility of getting of it.</note> attained, it were in vain to put you upon the ſeeking for it; but as it is neceſſary to enjoy it, ſo it is poſſible to find it; and three things may convince us of that.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, One <hi>is the power of God,</hi> to whom nothing is hard or impoſſible: 'Tis true, that an Almighty power muſt be put forth to make a Creature, and to make a new creature: But God is able to quicken the dead, and to reſtore his own image, and to ſlay and ſubdue the power of our ſins, and to create in us a new heart, and to put another ſpirit within us; whatſoever he doth command and require, he is able to give and work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond <hi>is the promiſe of God;</hi> you ſee here that he promiſeth to give a new heart, and upon this condition, if men will enquire of him for it, as he likewiſe upon the ſame terms promiſeth to give <hi>his holy Spirit to them that ask it,</hi> Luke 11. 13. Now the promiſe of God as it includes his power to perform what he hath promiſed, ſo it doth expreſs his intention and will to give what he promiſeth to give, if we ſeek unto him, and rely upon him.</p>
                     <p>The third is <hi>the work of God:</hi> He hath according to his Word of promiſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this new heart to many thouſands in the world; we find large Records of this in the Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 4. and we ſee manifold inſtances amongſt our ſelves what changes he makes in the hearts and lives of men, and many times of ſuch as have been very wicked, and utterly unworthy. <note place="margin">The Cautions what to avoid.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>2ly. The Cautions what to avoid if we would get a new heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="524" facs="tcp:55323:278"/>
If ever you would ſeek for, and obtain a new heart, then remember theſe five Cautions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Beware of <hi>a ſelf-deceiving opinion that you have it already;</hi> and that you <note place="margin">Beware of a ſelf-deceiving opinion that you have it.</note> (for your part) ſtand not under the want and need of it. This is that which undoth many hearers, when we preſs Chriſt and faith upon them, O they have believed on him: And when we preſs repentance, why, they need no repentance, they have repented long ago; and when we tell them they muſt be converted, they muſt be new creatures, they muſt get new hearts, O they need them not, their hearts are as good as the beſt, and they have very good natures and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: With this the <hi>Phariſees</hi> deceived themſelves; they were righteous and needed no repentance, and ſo they rejected Chriſt; and with this, <hi>Laodicea</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her ſelf; She <hi>was rich</hi> and <hi>increaſed, and ſtood in need of nothing;</hi> and yet ſhe <hi>was blind, and wretched, and naked, and poor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beware that you <hi>hearken not to the exceptions and prejudices of your</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of hearkning to the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your old hearts.</note> 
                        <hi>old and corrupt hearts,</hi> which are blind and cannot ſee the excellency of renewing grace, and which alſo are averſe, and have a natural antipathy unto it. You would not imagine (untill you come to the trial) what exceptions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions there are in our hearts againſt their Converſion and Renovation; Sometimes we look on it as a melancholly and troubling humour: ſometimes we look on it as a needleſs and vain preciſeneſs; ſometimes we look on it as a proud and unſociable quality; ſometimes we look on it as too low and mean a ſtate and practice for perſons of our greatneſs; ſometimes we look on it as that which will expoſe us to the contempts, and ſcoffs, and reproaches of men; ſometimes we look on it as the grave of all our delights and profits; ſometimes we look on it as a buſineſs utterly impoſſible for any man on earth: Now if any of theſe prejudices, or if any other beſides theſe prevail with us, we will then ſit quiet and contented with our old heart, and will never be perſwaded to look out for new hearts; therefore beſeech the Lord to deliver you from the lying vanities and prejudices of the old heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Beware of <hi>conſulting with worldly men, or ſetting up</hi> the favours <note place="margin">Of conſulting with worldly men.</note> or frowns of them: O if I ſhould become a new man, and lead a new life; if I ſhould regard holineſs, and life godly, I ſhould loſe favour, and hopes; how would my Parents look on me? what would my friends and acquaintance think of me! what oppoſition would befall me! how would men ſcoff and jear at me! and what reports and reproaches would they raiſe of me! let me tell thee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully, that if the Lord doth not in much mercy mortifie and ſubdue this weakneſs (that I ſay not wickedneſs) of ſpirit in thee, that thou art content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to enjoy thy old heart and courſes with the applauſes of the world, than to yeild in thy heart to Chriſt, and be willing and reſolute to get thy heart renewed by the Spirit of grace, although for this thou mayeſt meet with all ſorts of afflictions and reproaches from the world, thy poor ſoul will be for ever loſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Beware that <hi>you reſt not on your own ſtrength and ſufficiency,</hi> to renew or <note place="margin">Of reſting in your own ſtrength.</note> change your hearts; if you do, two fruits there will be of it.</p>
                     <p>1. You will either not ſeek to the Lord at all, or if you do, you will then ſeek him in a careleſs and unbelieving way.</p>
                     <p>2. Another is, you will but labour in vain, you will never be ſucceſſfull; for you have no ſtrength and ſufficiency of your own: <hi>Without me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, ye can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 5. And <hi>it is God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Beware that you neither <hi>delay, nor dally in uſing the means</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of delaying and dallying in the uſe of means.</note> 
                        <hi>to get this new heart:</hi> Do not ſay to morrow, the next year, when I am ſick, when I am old; theſe may be too late, and theſe may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to turn away his mercy, and to deny his Spirit, becauſe you put
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:55323:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him off, he may therefore juſtly put you off: Neither <hi>dally</hi> in the uſe of means, one while attending, another while neglecting; one while being fervent, and another while being remiſſe; one week going forward, and then for a year to fall backward, but reſolve to ſeek this new heart with all your heart, and with all your pains, following on, and preſſing forward, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till you enjoy this new heart, which God hath promiſed to give unto them that ſeek it.</p>
                     <p>3ly The <hi>wayes or meanes to get a new heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Strive to be <hi>willing that God ſhould make your hearts new,</hi> that he <note place="margin">The wayes to get a new heart</note> ſhould change and renew them by grace; <hi>Pars eſt ſanitatis velle ſanari;</hi> Jer. 13. 27. <hi>O Jeruſalem, wilt thou be made clean?</hi> Joh. 5. 6. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Be willing.</note> 
                        <hi>wilt thou be made whole?</hi> O that we could get thus farre, O Lord, I am weary of my old ſinful heart, I am willing that thou ſhouldeſt heal it, and reform it: If the unclean perſon were willing that God ſhould cleanſe him from his filthineſs; and the proud perſon were willing that God ſhould make him humble, this would be a fair ſtep to newneſs of heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Expreſſe this willingneſs in earneſt Prayers to God,</hi> who only is <note place="margin">Expreſs this willingneſs in earneſt Prayer.</note> able to give a new heart: Jer. 17. 14. <hi>Heal me, O Lord, and I ſhall be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſave me, O Lord, and I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let your Prayers have three Ingredients or Concomitants.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Sincerity;</hi> let them come from your very hearts, let them be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of your ſouls: <hi>My ſoule follows hard after thee,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8. <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early,</hi> Iſa. 26. 9. That the Lord may ſee that in very deed you would have your hearts changed, and nothing will ſatisfie you till he grant you that requeſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith;</hi> give up your earneſt requeſt for this in Faith, 1. Of <hi>Credence,</hi> that he can give it. 2. Of <hi>Reliance,</hi> that for his Chriſts ſake, and for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſake he will do it: Lord! It is thy promiſe to give a new heart, and all thy promiſes <hi>in Christ are Yea and Amen;</hi> none doth need the new heart more than I do, and none can give that heart but thy ſelf; and thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give it unto them that ask; I come unto thee in the Name of Chriſt, and do beſeech thee for his ſake to anſwer me according to thy Word; thou art able and faithful, thou wilt give what thou promiſeſt to give to them that ſeek thee; I believe all this, Lord help my unbelief, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Perſeverance;</hi> hold on this requeſt; and againſt all the rebellious workings of your old heart, and againſt all the fears, and diſputes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of your old hearts, yet lift up one Prayer more, and one Prayer more; you ſhall certainly prevail if you can perſevere in Prayer.</p>
                     <p>There are three Requeſts which a poor broken-heart is ſure to ſpeed in, if he will pray alwayes, and not faint; One is for a Chriſt, and another is for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy, and a third is for a new heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Diligently and patienly attend the Word,</hi> by which God converts, <note place="margin">Attend the Word.</note> and changeth, and renews the heart: Pſal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting ſouls.</hi> Jam. 1. 18. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us with the Word of Truth.</hi> Epheſ. 5. 26. <hi>That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the Word.</hi> How many old ſinful hearts hath God convinced and converted by his Word, that have come unto it with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and been ſent from it with knowledge! that have come to it with hardneſs, and have been ſent from it with tenderneſs! that have come to it with pride, and have been ſent from it with humility! that have come to it with all manner of profaneneſs, and have been ſent from it with all
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:55323:279"/>
manner of holineſs, with the Love of God, and fear of God, and hatred of ſin, and real purpoſe to walk with God in newneſs of obedience; O therefore attend the Word of the Goſpel, which is the power of God unto ſalvation, and therefore the power of God to Renovation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, <hi>beſeech the Lord to give you the uniting faith;</hi> that faith which will unite your hearts to Jeſus Chriſt, which will effectually bring you into <note place="margin">Begge uniting Faith.</note> relation with him, as Members of the Body of which he is the head; as Branches of himſelf the true Vine.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Why, what will this do, may ſome of you ſay?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I will tell you what it will do; it will infallibly bring in renewing grace to your hearts: You can never be changed and renewed Creatures, unleſs you <hi>be in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor 5. 17. For our ſpiritual life is in and from him; he is the Authour of life unto us, as <hi>Adam</hi> was the authour of death unto us: And he was anointed with the Spirit, that we from him might be Anointed with the Spirit: And if once you be united by Faith unto him, you partake of his Spirit to ſanctifie and renew, and conform you unto himſelf; <hi>He that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Why called a ſtony heart.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſo called, for the reſemblance which it hath with a ſtone; and in five particulars. 1. Unſenſibleneſs. 2. Unflexibleneſs. 3. Reſiſtingneſs. 4. Heavineſs. 5. Unfruitfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>it is an unſenſible heart:</hi> What ſenſe is there in a Rock? in a <note place="margin">An unſenſible heart.</note> Stone? in the Adamant? in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18, 19. hardened ſinners are ſaid to <hi>be paſt feeling;</hi> and that expreſſion, <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> ſeems to be taken from the hands of labouring men, which are ſo thickned, and hardned by pains, that they can graſp nettles and thorns, and yet not feel the ſharpneſs nor ſting; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heart is in this reſpect a ſtony heart, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> unſenſible. Though he hath as many ſins upon the ſoul which makes the very Creation to groan, and to travail in pain: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. yet he neither complains nor feels, he goes on f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om day to day, and adds drunkenneſs to thirſt, and drinks up iniquity as water, yet he ſaith, What evil have I done? and there is no iniquity in my doings; though the judgements of God be very near him, and the tokens do abundantly appear, yet like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when <hi>gray hairs were here and there upon him, he perceived them not,</hi> Hoſea 7. 9. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though the anger of the Lord be poured upon him, and <hi>ſets him on fire round about, yet he knows it not;</hi> nay, though it burn him, yet <hi>he lays it not to heart,</hi> Iſa. 42. 25. Such a groſs ſtupidity is there in the natural and ſtony heart. What one ſpake of himſelf in an humble way; <hi>Erubeſcenda video nec erubeſco, dolenda intueor nec doleo, peccata inſpicio</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bern. in Med. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>p.</hi> 1200.</note> 
                        <hi>nec geno;</hi> This, and much more may be ſaid of him that hath the hard and ſtony heart; he bluſhes not, he grieves not, he ſighs not for his ſins; nay, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth and boaſteth, and makes but a mock of ſin, ſo utterly unſenſible is he of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>it is an unflexible heart;</hi> you may bow a ſtick, and melt <note place="margin">An unflexible heart.</note> the braſs, and bend the very iron; but you cannot bow nor bend the ſtone; the ſtone may be broken in pieces, yet you can never ſo mollifie it as to make it to bow, it is naturally hard, and naturally unyielding. Thus it is with the heart which is hard, it is unflexible and unyielding; it will be what it hath been: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 7. It will not hearken, it will not obey, it will receive no inſtruction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, counſel; let God ſpeak, and do what he will; let men ſpeak, and do what they can, yet a hard heart fears not God, nor regards man. God ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with a command to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go; he rejects this command, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice?</hi> &amp;c. Then they ſhew wonders before him, yet he will not yield; then God ſends plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fruit and corn, and cattle, and ſervants, yet he will not yield nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Thus when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell ſick of the ſtone, I mean, when their hearts became hardned, then they became unflexible and unyielding. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. <hi>The Lord ſent Prophets to them early and late, but they mocked the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God, and deſpiſed his Word, and miſuſed his Prophets:</hi> You may read in <hi>Amos</hi> the 4th. how God dealt with them in manifold ways of judgement, yet there was no yielding; in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>He ſends them cleanneſs of teeth, and want of bread, yet have ye not returned unto me,</hi> ſaith the Lord; in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He with-held rain</hi> from them, yet ver. 8. <hi>have ye not returned unto me;</hi> in ver. 9. <hi>He ſmites them with blaſting and mildew;</hi> yet <hi>have ye not returned unto me;</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>He ſent the pestilence</hi> among them after the manner of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet <hi>have ye not returned;</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>He overthrew ſome of them,</hi> as he <hi>overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> and the reſt were as a fire-brand pluck't out of the fire, yet <hi>have ye not returned:</hi> O this is the hard heart, which when God ſpeaks, it will not hear; when God calls, it will not yield; though God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:55323:280"/>
it by mercies, yet it will not yield to leave ſin; though God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens it with wrath for continuing in ſin, yet it will not forſake ſin; though God plucks away mercies after mercies; though God lets down judgement after judgement; though he wounds the conſcience; though he throws it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, yet it will not yield to obey the voice of the Lord, to turn from ſin.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe it is <hi>a reſiſting heart;</hi> the hard ſtone doth not only not <note place="margin">A reſiſting heart.</note> receive impreſſion, but it reſiſts and turns back the ſtroaks; even ſo when the heart is hard, it doth not only not admit the Word, but inſtead of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it oppoſeth the Word, and reſiſts the Spirit of God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16. <hi>As for the Word which thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>but we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth out of our own mouth.</hi> Zach. 7. 11. <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears that they ſhould not hear.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>And made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the Law.</hi> Acts 7. 51. <hi>Ye ſtiffe-necked and uncircumciſed in heart, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence it is that ſinners of hard hearts are ſaid to make light of the Word, to deſpiſe it, to reject it, to mock at it, to contradict it, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and ſpeak againſt it, as the Phariſees and the Jews, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Becauſe it is <hi>an heavy heart;</hi> the ſtone is naturally heavy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending <note place="margin">A heavy heart.</note> and inclining downward; if you will find it, you muſt look for it in the earth; and if you throw it up, it will fall down again to the earth; that is its center, thither it inclines, and there it reſteth: So the hard heart, it is an heavy heart; not only heavy in a way of indiſpoſition and untowardlineſs to what is good, (no mind to pray or hear, or repent, &amp;c.) but alſo heavy in a way of inclination; it is an heart which inclines downward to worldly luſts, and ſinful luſts; in them it delights and reſts as in its center. Although ſometimes in an exigence of outward trouble, and inward anguiſh of conſcience it ſeems to be lifted up, yet upon the ceſſation of their working, it returns again to its old love and practice of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Laſtly, The hard heart is called a ſtony heart, becauſe it is <hi>a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A barren heart.</note> 
                        <hi>and unfruitful heart:</hi> What fruit is to be gathered from the ſtone or rock? Caſt the ſeed on it, let the rain come down from heaven upon it; let the Sun ſhine with its beams upon it, yet the ſtone is a ſtone ſtill, a barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful lump of earth: And thus is it with an hard heart; though the man lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many precious means of grace, and manifold helps, and daily opportunities; and though others are wrought upon by the Word, the Word brings forth in them the fruits of knowledge, of godly ſorrow, of repentance, of faith, of love, of newneſs of heart and life, &amp;c. yet in him it is unfruitful; though he lives under it many years, yet his heart is ignorant ſtill, and proud ſtill, and earthly ſtill, and filthy ſtill, he is not humbled nor changed, nor reformed at all.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have ſome Reaſons why the hard heart is called a ſtony heart: Now in the next place lets enquire:</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What kinds of ſtonyneſs or hardneſs of heart is to be found in man?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The kinds of hardneſs in man.</note> that ſo we may the more admire at the greatneſs of Gods mercy, who promiſeth to take it away out of our natures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> For this, know, that there is a threefold hardneſs incident to the heart of man.</p>
                     <p>1. One is <hi>Natural.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond is <hi>Habitual</hi> or Contracted.</p>
                     <p>3. The third is <hi>Judicial</hi> or Penal.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Natural hardneſs of heart,</hi> (is that Tomb-ſtone of ſin and death) <note place="margin">Natural hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> it is one part of that wretched nature conveyed unto us by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> by which our hearts are made dark and unſenſible of our ſins, and untoward,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:55323:281"/>
and diſobedient, and gain-ſaying, and unyielding, and refractory, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſet againſt the commands and ways of God, and the ſtrivings of his Spirit, and all his dealings, either in ways of mercy, or in ways of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This natural hardneſs, as it is in every man by nature, ſo it is in every part of man, in every faculty of his ſoul. In his <hi>underſtanding</hi> there is a wonderful incapacity and ſtupidity, and inapprehenſiveneſs of them, though diſtinctly opened, and often revealed truths and ways of God. In his <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> there is ſuch a hardneſs, that all the heavenly delivery of the mind of God in things pertaining to ſalvation, fall away as waters from the Rock, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and they ſlip away; they ſtay not ſometimes one minute, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſes are held faſt. In his <hi>judgement</hi> there is ſuch a hardneſs that raiſeth enmity and reſiſtance, and affords a world of carnal reaſonings to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and put by the truth In his <hi>will</hi> there is ſuch a hardneſs of obſtinacy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs, that when all is ſaid that can be ſaid by Law or Goſpel, yet men will not hear, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. though they may be ſaved; nor will they hear, though therefore they ſhall be damned. In his <hi>affections</hi> there is ſuch an hardneſs, that men ſin without fear, and without all compunction and ſorrow of heart; and though the glorious things of Chriſt are revealed and offered, and preſſed upon them, yet no delight, no love, no deſire at all can be raiſed in them, &amp;c. In his <hi>conſcience,</hi> which under all the threats of God, and terrors of God revealed, remains quiet, unſtirred, ſcared, and careleſs, as if theſe were fables, and impertinent notions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Contracted hardneſs</hi> is that which we bring upon our ſinful <note place="margin">Contracted hardneſs.</note> hearts (and adde unto them) by the frequency of our ſinning actions or practices, or by a voluntary oppoſing of all the means which do tend to the ſoftning our heart. And by the way let me tell you, that there are three kinds of ſinning which do extreamly ſuper adde to the hardning of mans heart.</p>
                     <p>One is the ſinning againſt <hi>clear light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the ſinning <hi>with delight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is the <hi>cuſtomary way of ſinning;</hi> long going in a path, often beating the anvile.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Judicial hardneſs,</hi> which is that unto which God gives the ſtubborn ſinner up for not harkning unto him, but ſtill continuing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting <note place="margin">Judicial hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> in a ſinful courſe; and therefore he leaves him unto himſelf, and to his own luſts, and his Spirit ſhall no more ſtrive with him; and hereupon the ſinful heart being left unto it ſelf, breaks forth into all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and ſo doth exceedingly obdurate it ſelf; it becomes more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and more fearleſs, and more enraged againſt all that is good, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſtony heart, or hard heart ſpoken of here in the Text, is principally that which is natural; and I will not deny that the Contracted hardneſs may be meant, but not the Judicial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. But how then may it be <hi>demonſtrated</hi> that naturally every mans <note place="margin">Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it.</note> heart is a ſtony or hard heart?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are ſix things which may convince us that it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The forwardneſs in men to ſin;</hi> every natural heart is ready to ſinful <note place="margin">The forwrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in men to ſin.</note> acts, and eaſie unto them: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 19. If temptations preſent themſelves, the natural heart preſently entertains them, and complies with them; and if no temptations from Satan and the world preſent themſelves, the natural heart will tempt it ſelf; why this is a conviction that the heart is hard; for if it be a good ſign of a tender and ſoft heart, when it is afraid to ſin: <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Joſeph?</hi> Gen. 39. 9.
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:55323:281"/>
Then ſurely it is a ſign of a hard heart when it is forward to ſin, and greedy to ſin, and eaſily and willingly lets out it ſelf to ſin, and fears not at all to ſin; but every mans heart (naturally) is ſo forward and bent to ſin, that it cannot, and it will not be reſtrained from ſin. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Nothing will be reſtrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</hi> Zeph. 3. 5. <hi>The unjuſt know no ſhame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſilence and quietneſs in conſcience under all ſinnings:</hi> Men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect <note place="margin">Quietneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinning.</note> all holy duties, and ſwea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and lie, and deceive, and are drunken, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, &amp;c. and conſcience ſaith nothing to them. Aſſuredly this is a ſtrong conviction, that their hearts are hard; for where there is any ſoftneſs of heart, there conſcience is alive, and hath ſome power to warn and check, and oppoſe before ſinning; and likewiſe to accuſe and condemn, and trouble after ſinning: But now natural men (generally) find it thus, that conſcience is dead, and takes no notice, or it is weak, and can do nothing with them; before ſinning it appears not, and after ſinning it troubles not. <hi>Ergo.</hi> their hearts are hard.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The ſecurity of heart:</hi> Taken me any one broken-hearted ſinner; <note place="margin">Security of heart.</note> why under the ſenſe of any one tranſgreſſion he goes heavy all the day long, and he weeps bitterly, and he waters his couch with his tears, and he is afraid of the Lord whom he hath provoked, and he makes in earneſtly for reconciliation and peace with God; and why doth he ſo? becauſe his heart is ſoft and tender. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the natural man he ſins, and is confident; expoſes himſelf to wrath, and yet is ſecure; and though God ſaith he is offended and diſpleaſed with him; and though God threatens him with wrath; and though he knows that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſome for the ſame ſin of which he is guilty, yet the man goes on in his ſinful practices, and makes no account of this. And what is the cauſe of it? it is this, his heart is hard, and hardened: Were not the man under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe, infinitely ſtupid and ſeared, he could not reſt ſo ſecure.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The abſence of all penitential works:</hi> Whenſoever the Lord gives <note place="margin">The abſence of penitential works.</note> a ſoft heart (which is oppoſite to this ſtony heart) then ariſeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A ſight and ſolemn conſideration of ſin.</item>
                        <item>2. An humble mourning and lamenting for ſin.</item>
                        <item>3. A ſelf-judging confeſſion of ſin.</item>
                        <item>4. A cordial averſation from ſin.</item>
                        <item>5. Importunate ſupplication for pardoning mercy and grace.</item>
                        <item>6. A ſerious application of the heart to Chriſt.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And on the contrary, where the heart is hard, there are none of theſe; no hard heart conſiders of its ways, ſaying, What have I done? no man ſmites on his thigh, and is humbled; no man repents; no man ſeeks after the Lord; no man cries out for mercy, or for grace, or for Chriſt. Certainly ſo much as there is of impenitency, ſo much there is of hardneſs of heart; but naturally every mans heart is impenitent, and he is not only a ſtranger to theſe penitential works, but alſo he is an enemy unto them: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The inefficacy of the Word;</hi> the Word of God is compared <note place="margin">The inefficacy of the Word.</note> ſometimes</p>
                     <p>1. To the <hi>Sun,</hi> which enlightens and quickens.</p>
                     <p>2. To <hi>water,</hi> which ſoftens and cleanſeth.</p>
                     <p>3. To the <hi>hammer,</hi> which bruiſes and breaks.</p>
                     <p>4. To <hi>fire,</hi> which heats and melts, and refines; but on the natural heart either it hath no efficacy at all, or it is a long time before it can make any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and yet a longer time before it make any ſaving impreſſion; either the heart will not ſuffer us to hear the voice of the Word, or it will not ſuffer us to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of the Word; or it is ſo hard, that it will not ſuffer us to do any thing according to the Word; indeed the heart is ſo hard, that unleſs the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be pleaſed to put out his Almighty power, it will never yield unto any ſaving operation of the Word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="532" facs="tcp:55323:282"/>
Sixthly, I will adde one Demonſtration more of the hardneſs of mans heart, <note place="margin">The unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs of it.</note> which is this, <hi>the unſenſibleneſs of that hardneſs of heart;</hi> naturally the heart is ſo hard, that it doth not, and cannot perceive its own hardneſs indeed; when grace comes into the heart, then a ſpiritual ſenſation comes into the heart, then we can feel our ſins, and feel our hardneſs, and complain of the one, and bewail the other: <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou hardened our hearts from thy fear?</hi> Iſa. 63. 17.</p>
                     <p>But while men are in this natural, ſinful condition, they are not ſenſible of their finful burdens, nor are they ſenſible of the unſenſibleneſs of their ſtupidity and hardneſs of their hearts. They are ſenſible of this loſs, and of that want, and can complain of this, and take on for that; but when did you ever hear a natural man complain of his hard heart? O I have ſuch an heart ſo full of ſin, and yet I cannot mourn for ſin; ſo unteachable, ſo untractable, ſo reſiſting, ſo oppoſing the Word of God, and ways of God! What ſhall I do? whether ſhall I go? O it is a burden that I cannot bear, &amp;c. Why, this unſenſibleneſs that our hearts are hard, it is a demonſtrative conviction that they are hard; and indeed no heart is more hard than that heart which is not ſenſible that it is hard.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to the uſeful Application of this unto our ſelves.</p>

Truly the hardneſs of mans heart is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which will not bow after ſo many gracious dealings of God, and the patience of God is more wonderful, who will bear ſo many, and ſo long affronts from a proud and hard heart.

If the School-Maſter hath a Scholar, which (after long teaching and inſtructing) continues dull and uncapable, he will meddle no more with him; Sir, I can do no good on your child. If a Maſter hath a Servant or an Apprentice, who (after all his care and pains to inſtruct him in his Trade) yet remains unapprehenſive and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and perhaps vicious, he longs to be rid of him. If a Parent hath a childe that is naught and ſtubborn, and will not hearken, nor be reclaimed, the Parent is. weary of him, and caſts him out of doors, or ſends him into another Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Thus none but God will bear with a hard and ſtubborn heart; God I ſay, who is moſt provoked by it; therefore unqueſtionably his patience is exceeding great, it is wonderful towards ſinners.</p>

                     <p>There are ſix things which give being and ſtrength to the hardneſs of mans heart.</p>

O get off this ignorance, which knows not what it is to ſin, nor what is the danger of ſinning, and therefore leaves the heart to his own vile inclination, and unto Satans temptations.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. A third is, It makes <hi>the Lord to abhor a perſon, (Every one that is proud in heart, is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16. 5.) and to leave a perſon, as the Lord <hi>left Hezekiah,</hi> becauſe his <hi>heart was lifted up,</hi> 2 Chron. 32. 25, 31.</p>

                     <p>2. And ſigh under the burden of thy hard heart; cry out, O that I were made ſenſible, and that I could pray to God to be cured!</p>
                     <p>3. And go to them that can pray, beſeech them to beſeech the Lord for thee: O Sirs, be ſenſible of one who is not ſenſible of himſelf; pray for me who cannot pray for my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Look a little on Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom thou haſt pierced, that thou mayſt <note place="margin">Look on Jeſus Chriſt.</note> mourn: <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10 Look on him, and what thy hard heart hath done unto him; thy hard heart it was which crucified him, which pierced him, which ſhed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood. And now hearken what Jeſus Chriſt ſaith unto thee, O hard-hearted ſinner, thy ſins have put my ſoul to grief, thy ſins have drawn tears from mine eyes, and blood from my heart: Thou haſt been very cruel to me, I will not be ſo to thee; lo, I offer my ſelf unto thee, and my blood unto thee; it ſhall waſh thee from all thy ſins, it ſhall make thy peace, it ſhall ſave thy ſoul, if yet thou wilt no more harden thy heart, but forſake thy ſins, and receive my offers: Methinks this cannot but bow and melt thee; if this doth not, what will? if the love of Chriſt, if the blood of Chriſt will not, nothing will: They ſay that the blood of the Lamb is that which can ſoften the Adamant; if any thing will work on, will melt an hard heart, it is the blood which came from the heart of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. By the <hi>collation of Faith</hi> which makes the ſinner willingly and really to cloſe with Chriſt: The Lord by his Spirit doth enable the broken-hearted ſinner to receive Jeſus Chriſt, and to take livery and ſeizin of a reconciled, merciful, loving, bleſſing God in and by him. And now the apprehenſion and poſſeſſion of all this rich mercy, and great love, and exceeding goodneſs of God in Chriſt melts and diſſolves the ſtonyneſs of the heart, this works in him a tenderneſs, a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, a pliableneſs, and all that is contrary to hardneſs of heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Lord takes away the ſtony heart from his people, <hi>ſucceſſively,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Succeſſively.</note> or by degrees; indeed the dominion of it is taken away in an inſtant, as ſoon as ever the ſinner is brought into Chriſt, as ſoon as he is called and converted, the raigning power of hardneſs is taken away, the man ſhall never have ſuch a ſtubborn, oppoſing, reſiſting, baſe heart any longer.</p>

                        <pb n="546" facs="tcp:55323:289"/>
But yet the grudging of the ſtone, the remaining gravel, the reliques of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are taken away by degrees; the remaining hardneſſe the Lord takes away</p>
                     <p>Firſt, one while by <hi>Afflictions:</hi> Pſal. 119. 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another while <hi>by mercies and kindneſſes:</hi> Ezek. 16. 60. <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Covenant with thee in the dayes of thy youth, I will eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Ver. 61. <hi>Then ſhalt thou remember thy wayes and be aſhamed.</hi> So Hoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 5. <hi>Afterwards ſhall the Children return and ſeek the Lord, and ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, Sometimes by <hi>his Word and Ordinances,</hi> which are like Refining fire to melt and purge away our droſs. How frequently do the people of God find the Word of God to be the power of God to melt away their careleſneſs, and their indiſpoſition of heart, and deadneſs of heart, and backwardneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulineſs of heart!</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Lord takes away the ſtony heart from his people <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>compleatly,</hi> Root and Branch; ſo that no part of it, and no degree of it ſhall <note place="margin">Perfectly.</note> ever be found in their hearts any more.

                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Now to the ſecond queſtion, why the Lord will take away the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why God takes away the ſtony heart, and that by promiſe. The Lord will do it, that They may be his people.</note> 
                        <hi>heart from his people? and why he himſelf doth undertake it by promiſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The Lord will take away the heart of ſtone from his people, That</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They may be his people,</hi> and receive him for their God and Lord: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, as long as hardneſs of heart prevails on any people, it is impoſſible that they ſhould become the people of the Lord; they will not hearken to his voice, nor obey his voice, nor receive his Laws, nor fall in with his offers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties; but will reject his Word, and deſpiſe his counſel, and will follow the luſts of their own hearts; and therefore of neceſſity the Lord muſt take away the hardneſs of heart; if he will have any people to be his people, he muſt break down the pride, and ſtoutneſs, and reſiſtance, and rebellion of their hearts; there muſt be a mutual will, and conſent, and agreement, which cannot be, till reſiſtance in our hearts be removed, that ſo our hearts may be made willing to comply with him, and with his will, and with his wayes, and with his works.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That he <hi>may bring them all into union with Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Bring them into union with Chriſt.</note> are a people given unto Chriſt from all eternity <hi>(Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me,</hi> Joh. 17. 6.) And as they are given to Chriſt by an eternal compact; ſo they muſt be given in to Chriſt in time by effectual vocation in a way of believing: And for this reaſon alſo he will take away the hardneſs of their hearts, which is imcompatible with cloſing with Chriſt; Heb. 3. 7. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice;</hi> ver. 8. <hi>harden not your hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That <hi>he may enjoy communion with them,</hi> and they with him: This is one Reaſon why he makes us to be his people, that he might make known all <note place="margin">Enjoy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them.</note> his love and goodneſs unto us, and that our hearts might be taken up with him, and ſet on him in love, and fear, and deſire, and joy and hope: None of which will or can be, unleſs the Lord were pleaſed to take away the heart of ſtone from his people, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That he <hi>may bring upon them all the good which he hath promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">And bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them all the good that he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> 
                        <hi>to his people, viz.</hi> All the bleſſings of mercy, and peace, and comfort, and joy, of which they are not capable untill the Lord take away the hardneſs of their hearts. Would you have the Lord to ſettle pardoning mercy on a hard heart!
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:55323:289"/>
and to ſpeak peace to a hard heart, and to revive with comfort and joy the ſoul of an hardened ſinner, who will hold faſt his iniquities, and who will not obey his voyce, and will none of him, This is as it were a foundation-work for the other works of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 2. Again, the <hi>Lord himſelf doth again by promiſe undertake to take away</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">God by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it. Becauſe of the impoſſibility of it.</note> 
                        <hi>the ſtony heart from his people,</hi> upon a twofold account.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, On the <hi>impoſſibility of the work</hi> without his own Omnipotency: None but the Almighty can cure the ſtone of the heart; neither Angels, nor Men, nor Miniſtry, nor Self-power; for the hard heart is too hard for all means whatſoever; only the Lord is too hard for it; he can ſubdue all the powers of ſin, and he can pull down all high imaginations which do exalt themſelves, and he can abaſe the pride of man, and he can circumciſe all the ſtoutneſs of the heart, ſo that the rebellious ſhall ſubmit themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The other, that <hi>his people</hi> (when they are made ſenſible of their <note place="margin">That men may not deſpair.</note> hardneſſe) <hi>may not deſpair,</hi> but may apply themſelves unto him who is able to work all their work in and for them, and to heal all their diſeaſes, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all their iniquities. Beloved, a Promiſe of God (in any kind) is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular foundation for Faith and Prayer: And ſo it is in this buſineſs of hardneſs of heart; if the Lord promiſe to take it away, then the work is poſſible, it may be done, and it is likewiſe <hi>de futuro,</hi> it ſhall be done: As the Lord is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatſoever he promiſeth to his people, ſo he is faithful and will perform the ſame. And both theſe are grounds for Faith and Prayer to go unto the Lord and beſeech him, and truſt upon him, that he will according to his word take away the hardneſs of our hearts.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>How this can be affirmed for a truth, ſeeing that much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How this can be, ſince much hardneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. A difference betwixt the hardneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the beſt, and that in the wicked. The godly are ſenſible of it.</note> 
                        <hi>of heart remaines in all the people of God, all the dayes of their lives?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This hath been anſwered in part already, in the manner how God takes away the hardneſs of heart from his people: only I will adde, that there is a vaſt difference 'twixt the hardneſs of heart remaining in the people of God, and that hardneſs of heart abiding in ungodly men, <hi>v. g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Though hardneſs of heart (in ſome degrees) remains in the people of God, yet <hi>they are ſenſible of it</hi> as their great evil and burden, and do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bewail it, and complain to the Lord of it, and cry out, <hi>Why haſt thou hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our hearts from thy fear?</hi> Iſa. 63. 17. But wicked men are unſenſible of the hardneſs of their hearts, they are <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> and <hi>their conſciences are ſeared as with a hot iron,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. When a part of the body is feared with a hot iron, it becomes utterly ſtupid and unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The hardneſſe of heart remaining in the people of God, it <note place="margin">It is ſtill mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying in the beſt.</note> 
                        <hi>is ſtill mortifying</hi> and decreaſing; the more they feel it, the more they pray againſt it, and never give over till they have obtained more grace and ſtrength againſt it, untill they find their hearts more tender and pliable: But the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart in ungodly men, as it is raigning, ſo it is raging, it ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto more hardneſs; ungodly men ſin more and more, and ſtill oppoſe the means of ſoftning their hearts; and the more they do ſin, the more they do harden their hearts; and the more they do oppoſe the light and means of ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the more they do augment their ſins and hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though hardneſs of heart doth remain in the people of God, yet <note place="margin">Though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, yet They do not willingly take thoſe wayes that tend to hardening.</note>

                     <p>Secondly, Then no marvel that the <hi>people of God are of another ſpirit, and</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then it is no ſign of an evil eſtate to be troubled for our own ſins, or for the ſins of others: David did water his couch for his own ſins,</hi> Pſal. 6. 6. <note place="margin">It is no ſign of an evil ſtate to be troubled for our ſins.</note>

Firſt, <hi>Melancholy</hi> is one thing, and <hi>hardneſs of heart</hi> is another thing: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy breeds an indiſpoſition to all works Religious and Civil; unfit to Pray, and unfit to Trade: But hardneſs of heart is rather an oppoſition than an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition: Melancholy indiſpoſeth for a time, for a fit; but when that is off, the ſoul is free again.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Indiſpoſition from temptation</hi> is one thing, and <hi>from affection</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: Temptations may deject the heart, and diſtract it; but theſe are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and burdenſome to the ſoul.</p>

                        <hi>(flies not as Doves to the windows)</hi> nor that <hi>hungring ſpirit</hi> after them as heretofore; he longs not for a Sabbath, nor doth his ſoul complain for his appointed food. It is with him as with a man on whom a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is ſeaſing; his ſtomack begins to fail him, and he mindes not his meat as he was wont to do: So it is with a good man on whom hardneſs of heart is ſeaſing; the Ordinances are not ſo precious and dear to him as heretofore, he falls in the high eſtimation of them, and in the wonted affectionateneſs of them, and the man can miſs many a Sermon quietly, and neglect any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:55323:291"/>
Ah friend, remember from whence thou art falling; conſider whither thou art going: Hardneſs is growing, when careleſneſs is riſing, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A <hi>flatneſs of ſpirit under the Ordinances:</hi> The time was that the <note place="margin">Flatneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</note> mans heart was to the Word, as wax to the ſeal; every part of the world would have wrought, and imprinted ſomething on his heart; a threatning would have ſtartled him; a Precept would have guided him; a promiſe would have revived him; there was ordinarily a vigour and warmth falling from the Ordinances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart. But now his heart is chill, and cold, and formal, and dead under the means of life; he is little or nothing ſtirred or moved: He comes and hears the ſound of the Word, but he ſeldome meets with the power of the Word; there is not that mourning, nor joy, nor fear, nor truſting as formerly: Divine Precepts do not quicken his heart; Divine Promiſes do not eſtablſh his heart; Divine Exhortations do not encourage and enlarge his heart; Divine Tryals and diſcourſes do not make him to ſearch his heart; Divine Rewards do not affect and open his heart as heretofore they have done.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>A careleſneſſe of mind after the Ordinances:</hi> Heretofore when the man had heard the Word, home he would go, and retire himſelf, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <note place="margin">Careieſneſſe of mind after Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</note> and confeſs, and pray, and bleſs the Lord; Lord! in ſuch a Point thou dideſt diſcover my ſin and failing, O pardon and heal me! in another thou didſt clear my doubts, be pleaſed ſtill to ſettle and quiet my ſoul; in another Point thou didſt ſhew me more of my work, O now grant unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant more of thy ſtrength; in another Point thou didſt raiſe my faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſoul; my ſoul did therefore love and bleſs thee. You would not imagine what pains the man took with a Sermon; after a Sermon what wreſtlings with God; what tears and cries to take out the leſſons of God, to be caſt into the mould of every Divine Truth.</p>
                     <p>O but now it is not ſo with him, he hath quickly done with the Word, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath read or heard the Word; the Word doth not dwell with him, nor go home with him; he is ſeldom in after Meditations, in after Applications, in after Supplications: The Word of God comes and goes; is heard and laid aſide; perhaps the man ſpeaks a little of it, but mindes it not as a Meſſage or Errand from God to him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>A remiſneſſe concerning private duties;</hi> when theſe begin either to <note place="margin">Remiſneſs in private duties.</note> be omitted, or ſeldomly to be performed; rather out of courſe than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without that intentiveneſs of minde, and without the labour of the heart and affections which God requires, and which the Chriſtian formerly found and expreſſed. <hi>v. g.</hi> The Chriſtians confeſſions, were wont to be with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſenſe of ſin, compunction, and brokenneſs of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judgings, mournings, ſhames, and condemnings of himſelf; his Prayers were wont to be ſtrong cries, importunate wreſtlings, vehement ſtrivings and pleadings in the name of Chriſt; humble urgings and preſſings of the promiſes of God, unſatisfiable thirſts after mercies, graces, comforts. O but now they are not ſo, or are very ſeldom ſo: This poor Chriſtian is ſcarce ſenſible of the ſins which he doth now confeſs; and ſcarce apprehenſive of any Spiritual good which he ſeems to crave; he doth not inſiſt on theſe with his ancient affections, and ancient expectations; he ſeemes to be ſatisfied with what he doth, and not with what he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: Ah friend! when the edge and fervor of the ſpirit is gone, when ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy daily degenerates into formality, ſurely tenderneſs is falling into hardneſs of heart. <note place="margin">Watchleſneſs over the ſpirit</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>A watchleſneſſe over the ſpirit</hi> or ſoul; it is not minded, obſerved, lookt unto in its motions, affections, tranſactions as formerly; but the guard is drawn off; there is leſs fear, and more ſecurity; leſs diligent care and more looſe preſumption. The man was wont to keep his heart with all diligence, narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the paſſages and workings of his Spirit, the inclinations of his heart,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:55323:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
temptations of Satan, behaviours of every day, alone and in company; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did apply himſelf with variety of petitions to God, and humbled himſelf for what was amiſs, and renewed his ſtrength in the Lord for the time to come: O but now it is not thus; the precious ſoul is neglected, the City is not watched, the thoughts, and affections, and actions are not obſerved, the poor man is aſleep, and drowſie, and his ſpirituall frame is impaired, and he conſiders it not.</p>
                     <p>2ly <hi>The ſadneſſe of this condition.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The ſadneſs of this condition. It is an evill diſtemper.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is <hi>a very evil and naughty distemper;</hi> an hard heart ſoftning, that is good; but the ſoft hardning again, that's very evil. Was it good to tremble at the Word? what is it now not to be moved by the Word! was it good to think of ſin, and mourn? what is it now to hear of thy ſins, and not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at all! was it good to act duties with affections and life? what is it now to neglect the duties, or to act them with a heavy and careleſs Spirit!</p>
                     <p>There are four things which ſhew this hardning to be very evil.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The marvellous ingratitude in it,</hi> that the Lord ſhould ſhew ſo much mercy to heal the diſeaſe, and yet you relapſe into it again.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is an expreſs <hi>ſelf-condemnation;</hi> why! you were exceedingly troubled at the hardneſs of your hearts, and prayed againſt it, and ſought the prayers of others, and now to harden your hearts again!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is <hi>preſumption in it,</hi> you do tempt the Lord by it; Do you mean to continue in this caſe? then you are undone; do you mean to come out of it? why do you then tempt the Lord by falling into it, and preſuming on his grace to recover you?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you look not ſpeedily to your ſelves, <hi>where think you will this hardning end!</hi> perhaps in ſome great deſertion, perhaps in ſome great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion! perhaps in ſome exceeding great and long trouble of conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It <hi>is a very uncomfortable condition:</hi> How is thy Sun eclipſed! <note place="margin">It is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable condition.</note> and thy Spring cut off! what is become of that ſpirit of Prayer? what is become of that excellent aſſurance of which thou haſt ſo much ſpoken? where is that ſweetly excuſing teſtimony of Conſcience! what is become of that joy in the Holy Ghoſt? and that peace with which thou waſt wont to work? Ah! thou haſt ſuffered thy heart to harden again, and God looks not on thee as he was wont, and Conſcience ſpeaks not as it was wont, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God manifeſts not himſelf as he was wont, and Ordinances ſmile not on thee as they were wont, nor doth Providence ſhine upon thy Tabernacle as it was wont: But inſtead of theſe, thou meeteſt with many a ſharp affliction, with many piercing reproofs, with many a ſad item, and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſcourges, which no man knows and feels (in the ſting and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it) but thou thy ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is a <hi>very formal and empty eſtate;</hi> how may it grieve thee to ſee <note place="margin">It is an empty ſtate.</note> a fruitleſs Vintage of thy ſoul? Tell me what returns haſt thou had all this while that this hardning diſtemper hath been upon thee! thou heareſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and negligently; what haſt thou been the better for all the Sermons which thou haſt heard! thou prayeſt coldly and formally; and what good hath returned upon thy ſoul after them! thou haſt had no trading all this while at heaven! how dull muſt grace be which is not uſed! and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying muſt thy Spiritual ſtrength be, which all this while recovers no more ſtrength?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is <hi>a very dangerour poſture;</hi> though it be not abſolute Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, <note place="margin">It is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous poſture.</note> yet it looks toward it. Though I will not ſay that it is the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the grace of God into wantonneſſe, yet it bends towards it: Though it be not falling from grace, and though it be not a forſaking of God; yet

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>By all means find out the cauſe</hi> or cauſes of the hardning; obſerve well</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What conſcience tells thee in thy bed at night, or in the day of fear and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or in a day of Solemn Humiliation, or in the meditation of thy ſhort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances before God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>What the Word of God hints and points at in thee,</hi> at what it levels and ſtrikes; there is an arrow (ſome time or other) ſhot which falls into thy very heart; a meſſage that is ſecretly delivered in way of conviction and reproof, which ſaith, Thou art the man, and this is thy way and thy doings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>What thy faithful and watchful friends ſay unto thee;</hi> what their ſuſpicions and fears are, and unto what their friendly counſels do tend. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one but ſome of theſe things (which I ſhall mention) have brought on thee this new hardneſs upon thy heart.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either <hi>ſpiritual pride,</hi> this hath made thee to neglect thy watch, and to neglect the Ordinances.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or a <hi>worldly ſurfet;</hi> thou haſt been taking in too much of the world, and worldly buſineſs, and this hath robbed thee of thy precious time, to converſe at heaven, to meditate, to examine, to read, to hear, to pray, to confer with thy Fellow-Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Or the <hi>deceitfulneſs of ſin:</hi> Thou haſt ventured on leſſer ſins, and they have enſnared thee, and drawn thee to greater ſins, and theſe have brought upon thee the hardneſs of thy heart again, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When you have found out the ſpiritual cauſes by which your hearts <note place="margin">Judge your ſelves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> have been hardned, then <hi>judge your ſelves and repent; remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent,</hi> ſaid Chriſt unto <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. Nay, do not ſtay to look when this hardning will fall off from thee; but haſten, but compel thy ſelf to retiredneſs, and to a penitential conſideration of thy hardning with the cauſes of it, and the great evils in it, and fall down before the Lord in humble confeſſions of thy great back-ſlidings, and poure out prayer upon prayer: O wreſtle with the Father of mercies for his Chriſts ſake to pity, and pardon, and heal, and once more to cure and recover thee: Follow on to ſeek the Lord, though he doth ſecretly upbraid thee, though for a while he delays thee; though to thy apprehenſion thy heart is more hardned, yet pray, and yet pray that God would heal thy back-ſlidings: Praiſe the Lord in the Name of Chriſt, preſenting his Covenant unto him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he promiſeth to take away the heart of ſtone. And this contains in it not only the natural or original hardneſs of heart, but alſo the accidental contracted hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his people; the Covenant of taking away the heart of ſtone extends to both of them: O Lord, cure this hardning as well as the former hardneſs: I have hardned the heart which thou haſt ſoftned, O do thou ſoften the heart which I have hardned; revive thy work, and quicken my almoſt dead heart, reſtore my ſoul, and recover my ancient eſtimations, affections, tenderneſs, love, fear, care, zeal, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If the Lord (at length) begins to make thy heart to relent by <note place="margin">Bleſs God for any ſoftning.</note> his Word or by his Rod, or by his Spirit, <hi>O bleſs his Name; He is come, he is come,</hi> ſaid the Martyr; ſo, &amp;c. get thee into a corner, help on the ſpring, pump the water when the water comes, enlarge thy confeſſion, abound now in ſupplications.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Be <hi>earneſt with God to pardon thee, and to give thee aſſurance</hi> of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning <note place="margin">Be earneſt for pardon and aſſurance.</note> of this hardning, and be importunate with him for it; I tell thee ſuch a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſurance will preſently ſoften and melt thy ſoul, aſſuredly raiſe and reſtore
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:55323:293"/>
thy ſoul to thoſe careful and tender communions with God, and watchful walking with him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, When you are recovered, then bleſs God and <hi>keep up tenderneſs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Keep up ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of heart.</note> 
                        <hi>of heart,</hi> and beware of ſuffering hardneſſe to grow upon your hearts again.</p>

                  <p>Doct. 3. <hi>THat God will not only take away the heart of ſtone from his people,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">All the people of God have a ſoftned heart given them.</note> 
                     <hi>but alſo he will give them an heart of fleſh;</hi> or that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have ſoft and tender hearts given unto them.</p>
                  <p>And by the way, before I inſiſt upon this Point, obſerve two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Gods works in reſtoring and renewing of man, are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> terminated in Privatives, or Negatives; but they are Poſitive alſo and Collative: Evill is removed, and good contrary to that evill, comes in the place of it. He doth take away the old heart, and alſo he gives a new heart; he takes away the heart of ſtone, and alſo he gives an heart of fleſh: He takes away ignorance, and gives knowledge; he takes away pride, and gives humility; God is a wiſe and perfect Agent; he will not only deface and aboliſh Satans Image, but alſo he will repair his own Image; he will not only root up what is evil, but alſo he will plant and lay foundations, and build up. Therefore have a care of your ſelves, that you be not deceived in the judgement of your conditions; you are not ſo wicked as you were; but what good is wrought in your hearts? what contrary quality unto the former evil, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as to the converſion or change of the ſinner, all the work reſts on God; he doth all, he works all; if the heart of ſtone be to be removed, he muſt do that work, he muſt take it away; and if the heart of fleſh be to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, he muſt alſo do that work; he muſt give unto us the heart of fleſh; power againſt evil, and power to any good, all from God; we are the Patients, he is the Agent; we are the receivers, he is the giver; you cannot take away the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your own hearts, nor can you give unto your ſelves an heart of fleſh; both of them are the work of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being briefly premiſed, I now come to the Propoſition it ſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> That the people of God are the people of ſoft and tender hearts; God gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them (unto every one of them) an heart of fleſh; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a tender and ſoft heart. An heart of fleſh (in this place) ſtands in oppoſition to the heart of ſtone, to the unſenſible, unmournful, ſtubborn, unyielding, reſiſting heart, and it notes a ſenſible mourning, relenting, yielding, complying, tender, teachable and tractable heart.</p>

                        <hi>heart is?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To underſtand this, you muſt remember that there is a fourfold ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">A fourfold ſoftneſs.</note> or tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, One is <hi>Natural,</hi> and this is that which we call commonly a good nature, <note place="margin">Natural.</note> and tender diſpoſition, and a ſoftly ſpirit, on which any thing is apt to work, any harſh word, any ſad news, any affliction, any croſs, any thing that hath the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of calamitous or grievous.</p>
                     <p>This tenderneſs or ſoftneſ:, is not the ſoft heart here in the Text; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is <hi>no heavenly quality,</hi> nor is it let in by heavenly means; a man never got this tenderneſs by praying, or hearing, or reading, or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is <hi>ſuch a ſoftneſs as leaves a perſon in as great a pliableneſs</hi> (nay greater) <hi>to evil, than to good:</hi> You may as ſoon draw them to an Ale houſe, and Play-houſe, and Gaming-houſe, as to Gods houſe; they cannot deny their friend and requeſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding this ſoftneſs and tenderneſs, yet <hi>a mans heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſpiritually hardned;</hi> for take me this ſoft natured perſon which can weep almoſt at every thing, and put him upon mourning for his ſins, for his long ignorance, for his manifold profaneſs, for his exceeding unprofitableneſs under the means of grace; why, this ſoft-natured man now cannot ſhed a tear, and is ordinarily ſo far from relenting and mourning that even his heart riſeth againſt what you ſpeak, and is extreamly incenſed, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſecond is <hi>Moral,</hi> which ariſeth from education and learning, <note place="margin">Moral.</note> and is of that force as to reſtrain and civilize, and ſcowre off the barbarous rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit and behaviour, and trims up the perſon to a gentleneſs of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but neither is this the heart of fleſh in the Text; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This is but an <hi>outward</hi> and ſeeming ſoftneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If any thing of it may be ſaid to be inward, yet it flows not from any work of grace, but from the <hi>Rules of Moral Philoſophy,</hi> admitted i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>to the underſtanding, as fit to be received and practiſed for a mans reputation in the world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>not Divine;</hi> it is a tenderneſs to reſpect men, when all this while there is a ſtubbornneſs, and reſiſtance, and unyieldingneſs, and a conſtant irreſpectiveneſs to God and his will and ways.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The third is <hi>a legal tenderneſs,</hi> which is the yielding tenderneſs <note place="margin">Legal.</note> and pliableneſs of the heart under the ſenſe of Gods dreadful wrath for ſin; what will not a ſinner do in ſuch a caſe? he will pray and hear, and forbear, and do what God will have him to do, and forſake what God will have him forſake; but this is not the heart of fleſh neither; for</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This is but <hi>anguiſh of heart,</hi> it is not tenderneſs of heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>This will off when anguiſh is off;</hi> like Iron that is ſoftned in the fire, when the fire is taken away, it grows more hard: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> yet hardned his heart more, when God gave him ſome reſpite.</p>

3. The ſinner is <hi>quickly weary of this tenderneſs,</hi> and would with all his heart be rid of it; but ſo it is not in the right ſoftneſs.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, It is <hi>a gracious temper</hi> or frame of heart] no man hath it, but firſt <note place="margin">It is a gracious temper.</note> he partakes of the Spirit of grace; his heart is converted and renewed by grace; before the work of grace, the heart is ſtubborn and rebellious, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and gain-ſaying; the natural man is a child of diſobedience as well as of wrath; he is ſtiffe-necked, and unto every good work reprobate; but when grace enters into the heart, now his heart is changed and ſubdued, and mollified, and is eaſie to be intreated, and is ready to take any impreſſion that God will ſtamp upon it. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 33. <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a <hi>temper</hi> or <hi>frame of heart]</hi> it is not an occaſional and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient <note place="margin">A temper of heart.</note> work, but an inherent and permanent, and fixed work upon the ſoul; <label type="milestone">

                        </label> even wicked and hardned ſinners may have ſome fits and appearances of ſoftneſs, as ſome hard ſtones (in change of weather) appear to be moiſt; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> under ſome of Gods judgements did relent; and <hi>Ahab</hi> under thoſe ſharp threatnings of God did humble himſelf; and <hi>Felix</hi> upon the hearing of <hi>Paul,</hi> did tremble; and the <hi>Iſraelitet</hi> in their diſtreſs did cover the Altar with tears; and <hi>Judas</hi> with the terror of conſcience did repent; but theſe were fits and paſſions only, they did not laſt and abide on their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when exigences were off, their natural hardneſs appeared again. It is not thus when God gives an heart of fleſh; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a tender and ſoft heart; for this dwells and reigns, and continues in all eſtates, in all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; in perplexity, and in adverſity; in freedom, and in danger; under bleſſings as well as under afflictions.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is ſuch a temper, whereby the <hi>whole heart becomes a melting and</hi>

                        <hi>yielding heart,</hi> and pliable, and flexible; the Scripture calls it ſometimes a <hi>contrite heart,</hi> Pſal. 51. 17. ſometimes a <hi>trembling heart,</hi> Iſa. 66. 2. ſometimes a <hi>tender heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 34. 27. ſometimes a <hi>mourning heart,</hi> Zach. 12. 10, 11. ſometimes an <hi>obedient heart,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. ſometimes an heart that <hi>bows</hi> and <hi>ſtoops to receive the Word of God,</hi> Deut. 33. 3.</p>
                     <p>And this ſoftneſs and pliableneſs ſpreads <hi>over the whole ſoul</hi> when God gives an heart of fleſh. <note place="margin">It ſpreads over the whole ſoul.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>mind</hi> is willing to ſee, and to be taught, and know the mind of God; his will, his way, his work concerning us. <hi>Teach me thy truth,</hi> and <hi>teach me thy way,</hi> and <hi>teach me thy will,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal: 27. 11. <hi>Let us go up to the houſe of the Mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths,</hi> Iſa. 2. 3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>judgement</hi> is willing and ready to aſſent, and to acknowledge the truths and commands of God; the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>I eſteem thy precepts</hi> to be <hi>right,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 1 19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>will</hi> is made tender and pliable: <hi>I will keep thy ſtatutes,</hi> Pſal. 119. 8. <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandments,</hi> Ver. 32. <hi>The Lord is our God, and him will we ſerve,</hi> Joſh. 24. 18.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All the <hi>affections</hi> are tender and pliable: O what propenſions to mourn for ſin (they that eſcape of them <hi>ſhall be on the Mountains as Doves of the Valley, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity,</hi> Ezek. 7. 16.) and ſo a tender <hi>fear,</hi> they <hi>fear the Lord and his goodneſs,</hi> Hoſea 3. 5. a tender <hi>love,</hi> a tender <hi>delight, &amp;c.</hi>

Joſeph</hi> was ſo both to <hi>God</hi> (Gen. 39. 9. <hi>How can I do wickedneſs, &amp;c?)</hi> and to <hi>Man;</hi> How tender to his father and brethren? <hi>Job</hi> was ſo, and ſo was <hi>Peter,</hi> on whom one <hi>look</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did work ſo kindly, that he <hi>went out and wept bitterly.</hi> What ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Jehoſhaphat, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah, Nehemiah, Ezra, Daniel,</hi> or of <hi>Paul,</hi> or of the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>Ye are the Epiſtle of Chriſt, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart;</hi> nay, ſee more of this ſoftneſs and tenderneſs: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Behold this ſame thing, that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your ſelves; yea, what indignation; yea, what fear; yea, what vehement deſire, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

But we will not be bound up to the ſtraight path of life, we will allow our ſelves ſuch a looſneſſe of Opinion, and ſuch a looſneſs of ſpeaking, and ſuch a looſneſs of walking, which the Lord doth not only not allow, but expreſly forbids and condems in his Word; aſſuredly this is farre from the frame of tender and ſoft hearts.</p>

Nevertheleſs we do find it among our ſelves, that many perſons do ſlight and mock at the reproofs and threatnings of the Word, and do miſuſe the Meſſengers of God when reproving their ſins, and applying thoſe threatnings which God himſelf hath denounced againſt them for their ſinnings: As (like <hi>Solomons</hi> fool) they do make a mock of ſin, ſo like thoſe hardned Jews, they do make but a mock of Gods threatnings for their ſins, deſpiſe and laugh at them, whereas they ſhould humble their hearts under them, and repent of their ſins, that ſo they may avoid that wrath which God threatens them for their ſinnings.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>They will not be brought under the obedience of it,</hi> let the Lord do what he will: <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>I have hewed them by the Prophets, I have ſlain them by</hi>

on whom no mercies of God will work; why, nothing will work, if mercy will not work.</p>
                        <p>Now there are ſix choice merciful dealings of God, which yet work not to any purpoſe on the hearts of many men; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Gods merciful Providence. 2. Gods merciful Treaties. 3. Gods merciful Strivings. 4. Gods merciful Waitings. 5. Gods merciful Warnings. 6 Gods merciful Repentings.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods merciful Providence,</hi> in manifold, nay in daily fruits of preſervation, <note place="margin">His merciful Providences.</note> and deliverance, of goodneſs and bleſſings; the Lord it is who gives us life, and all things that pertain to life; he feeds our bellies, and clothes our backs, and maintains our health, and multiplies our ſeed ſowen, and makes us to proſper, and thrive, and with this hedge hath our portion been ſecured. Yet this Providential mercy and goodneſs of God doth not work kindly and effectually on the hearts of many men; no penitential plyableneſs and obedience at all: Hoſ. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and laid meat unto them.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>But they refuſed to return.</hi> Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of the goodneſs, and forbearance, and longſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> ver. 5. <hi>But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, &amp;c.</hi> Nay inſtead of yielding unto and complying with God by reaſon of his good hand of bleſſing, many ſinners do therefore grow more diſobedient and wicked: <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy proſperity, but thou ſaydſt, I wilt not hear,</hi> Jer. 22. 21. Deut. 32. 15. <hi>But Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuron waxed fat, and kicked; then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rock of his Salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods merciful Treaties.</hi> The Lord ſends the Goſpel unto a people, <note place="margin">His merciful Treaties.</note> and by that ſets open his Mercy-ſeat, and ſets up his Throne of Grace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims himſelf to be the Lord, the Lord gracious and merciful in goodneſs and truth, and by it reports unto ſinners, that he hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for them, that he hath (out of his infinite love) ſent his own Son Jeſus Chriſt into the world to ſave ſinners, and that whoſoever believes on him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. And he offers his Chriſt unto ſinners, invites them, commands them, earneſtly urgeth them to come unto him, to receive him, to believe on him, and aſſures them of the pardon of all their ſins, and of eternal life; nay, intimates clearly, that though they have no worthineſs, yet they may come and drink of the water of life freely. O what merciful dealing is this, and yet after all this, the hearts of many ſinners are no more ſtirred or drawn than the ſtones or Rocks! <hi>Who hath believed our report!</hi> ſaith the Prophet. <hi>Who hath belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our report!</hi> ſaid Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>Who hath believed our report!</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle; Sinners are not gathered, and <hi>ye will not come unto me that ye might have life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods merciful Strivings;</hi> what he offers by his Word, he preſſeth the <note place="margin">His merciful Strivings.</note> ſame (ofttimes) by his Spirit, who follows our hearts with one work after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; with Humiliation, and then with Conviction, and then with Pulſation, and Excitation; the Spirit of God doth (ofttimes) make ſinners to ſee their ſins, and their need of Chriſt, and that their life, and health, and hope is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ly in him, and in no other Name; and that they ſhall certainly periſh and be damned if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not; nay, he troubles their Conſciences, and ſets them a work to regard Jeſus Chriſt, and to comply with his excellent ſelf and gracious offers; and yet all this is loſt; many ſinners harden their hearts, and will not put their necks into his yoke, they will not have him to raign over them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods merciful waitings:</hi> The Lord doth not preſently take the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial <note place="margin">His merciful Waitings.</note> and forfeiture, but waits that he may be gracious; comes to the door again, renews the offer, ſends one ſervant, and a ſecond, and a third; gives yet more time, he waits thus on ſinners; more than three years, ſometimes more than twenty years, ſometimes more than fourty years, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more than ſixty years (for ſo long, and perhaps longer doth he
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:55323:298"/>
continue his Goſpel to them) yet after all his patient waiting, many ſinners do continue as they were, ignorant, proud, obſtinate, impudent, and unbelieving, and are not drawn either by the goodneſſe, or by the patience of his grace.</p>
                        <p>Fithly, <hi>Gods merciful warnings;</hi> when all this works not on ſinners, then the <note place="margin">His merciful Warnings.</note> Lord gives notice unto them, that if they will not hearken unto his voice of mercy, he will forſake them, he will give them up unto their own hearts luſt, and they ſhall periſh, and never enter into his reſt: Joh. 8. 24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins.</hi> Hebr. 2. 2. <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward;</hi> ver. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſuch great ſalvation, which at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſpoken of by the Lord!</hi> Heb. 12. 25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven!</hi> And yet all the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God that he will not bear any longer, that he will cloſe up the day of grace, that refuſers of his grace in Chriſt ſhall not eſcape, but ſhall receive a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward for their diſobedience; I ſay, all theſe move not many ſinners at all; but though they muſt die in their ſins, periſh and be damned for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, yet will they not yeild to come to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Gods merciful recoilings or repentings, (i. e.)</hi> when the Lord (being ſo <note place="margin">His merciful Repentings.</note> contemned and provoked by proud and obſtinate ſinners) draws out his wrath, and is now ready to execute vengeance on them that obey not his Goſpel; his hand is even ſtretched out to deſtroy, yet his bowels work within him, and his mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with his juſtice for a little forbearance and trial: Luk. 13. 7. <hi>Behold theſe three yeers I come ſeeking fruit on this figtree, and find none? cut it down. O Lord let it alone this year alſo, &amp;c.</hi> Hoſe. 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together?</hi> ver. 9. <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſſe of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man.</hi> Nevertheleſs though God repents of his wrath, yet how few do repent of their ſins! they do not return to the Lord, nor ſeek him, for all this! by all which it doth evidently appear that many ſinners are deſtitute of all ſpiritual ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of heart.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, The <hi>Exigential ſoftneſs</hi> and tenderneſs; I mean that which ariſeth only from fear of puniſhment, as in <hi>Ahabs</hi> caſe, or from that preſent ſenſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">An exegential ſoftneſs.</note> as in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe: You would not imagine what tenderneſs may appear in men while the rod is held over them, or whiles the rod lies heavy upon them; penal evils have a marvellous contrariety unto our natures, and they have (many times) a ſtrong authority with us; the rod of God commands and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that from us which the Word of God cannot, becauſe our natures are ſervile, and are more ready to act out of fear, than out of love. Hence is it that we read of ſuch a quick plyableneſs in diſtreſſed and puniſhed ſinners unto the will of God. Pſal. 78, 34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God.</hi> ver. 35. <hi>They remembred that God was their Rock, and</hi>
                           <pb n="565" facs="tcp:55323:298"/>
                           <hi>the high God their Redeemer. Nevertheleſs,</hi> ver. 36. <hi>they did flatter him with the mouth, and they lyed unto him with their tongues.</hi> Hoſe. 5. 15. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> Chap. 6. 1. <hi>Come and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up.</hi> Judg. 10. 15. <hi>And the children of Iſrael ſaid unto the Lord, Do thou unto us whatſoever ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good unto thee.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>And they put away the strange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord.</hi> How many perſons in times of common judgements, and in perſonal ſickneſſes, how mournful, prayerful, dutiful! yet their hearts are not ſoftned.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>The Legal ſoftneſs,</hi> which is when Conſcience is awakened with the <note place="margin">Legal ſoftneſs.</note> ſenſe of Gods wrath; O what a ſoftneſs, what a tenderneſs, what a plyableneſs doth there appear in perſons at ſuch a time as this? they will weep moſt bitterly; they will pray moſt earneſtly; they will hear moſt diligently; they will not come near to ſin, or the occaſions thereof, they ſet upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eformation; what may not God have now from them? what reſolution, Covenants? yet all this is but iron in the fire; all this is but a Mariner in a ſtorm, but a Sea ſickneſs; all this is but forced work; all this crouching is but to compound the ſooner; ſelf-love, and ſelf-eaſe, and ſelf-fear, and ſelf-deceit are the Grounds and Reaſons of this ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or tenderneſs: And when this Conſcience troubled ſinner hath got ſafe to land, and all grows quiet and calm, then his tenderneſs and plyablneſs is gone; he laies aſide his cares, and fears, and tears, and reformations, and reſolutions, and he returns to folly again, and his heart grows more hard, and more unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and unmournful, and unflexible and diſobedient than before.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Partial ſoftneſſe,</hi> which is, when the heart of man is uneven in <note place="margin">Partial ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> this work of tenderneſs; it appears in ſome things, but not in other things, <hi>v. g.</hi> In trouble for ſin, where the ſin hath been foule and notorious, now the man is ſenſible and troubled, but not ſo for ſpiritual ſins which are more diſhonouring of God, and more dangerous, though leſs infamous amongſt men; ignorance, guile of heart, unbelief, &amp;c. In commiſſion of ſin, a tenderneſs is like to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered when it is with them as with thoſe, <hi>Job</hi> 24. 17. <hi>If one know them, they are in the terrors of the ſhadow of death,</hi> but none, if it may be carried with ſecurity; <hi>Jehu</hi> is againſt <hi>Ahabs</hi> idolatry, but not againſt <hi>Jeroboams</hi> idolatry. Some have a tenderneſs not to ſwear, but no tenderneſs to lye, and ſlander, and ſpeak idly: In practice of obedience there may be a tenderneſs, not wholly to neglect it, but no tenderneſs conſcienciouſly to perform it; a tenderneſs in duties to man, but no tenderneſs in duties to God.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Temporary ſoftneſſe,</hi> which may be great, even to zeale, and yet at length it wears away; what an earneſtneſs have we ſeen in ſome againſt ſin! <note place="margin">Temporal ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> and what a forwardneſs in duties! nay they have ſeemed very much to bewaile their own ſins, as well as to bewail the ſins of others; and to put on themſelves as well as others to the practice of duties both publick and private; and yet after a while this tenderneſs is loſt; their jealouſie, and watchfulneſs, and provocation of themſelves and others, it is gone; they grow very negligent, very careleſs, and may perhaps be found amongſt the companions of profaneneſs, and ungodlineſs: Again, ſome in the hearing of a Sermon, in good company, &amp;c. as <hi>Felix</hi> when he heard <hi>Paul,</hi> may expreſs much tenderneſs. This tenderneſs doth nor ariſe from renewing grace, but from ſome ſecret laſh in conſcience, or from ſome inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſs of ſpirit, or from ſome carnal deſign, or from vain glory, &amp;c..</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Worldly ſoftneſs:</hi> I have obſerved a kind of tenderneſs, and ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and ſoftneſs in ſome perſons.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, When they would get ſome worldly things, as the <hi>Shechemites</hi> would be <note place="margin">Worldly ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> circumciſed upon this ground, <hi>Shall not their cattel and their ſubſtance be ours!</hi> Gen. 34. 22, 23. O how many perſons will come to the publick Ordinances, hear the beſt Miniſters, be acquainted with them, order their converſations
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:55323:299"/>
demurely, and inoffenſively, yea, and religiouſly; and all this is but to get ſome good match, or ſome rich place.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, When they have loſt ſome worldly things, a Husband, a Wife, a Child, a Parent, a Friend, an Eſtate; now they melt into tears, mourn, and will not be comforted! they accuſe their ſins, and ſend for a Miniſter, and what muſt they do! But this ſoftneſs is only worldly ſorrow, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Deſperate ſoftneſſe,</hi> and tenderneſs of deſpair: And indeed when <note place="margin">Deſperate ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> any one doth deſpair, there is in him an exceeding and ſurpaſſing ſenſibleneſs; he is deeply ſemſible of his ſins, and dejected, and overwhelmed in the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, and often cries out in an amazing manner concerning them, and the wrath of God for them, and the expectation of judgement and deſtruction. But this is alſo a falſe tenderneſs of heart, and it comes not from faith, and is not raiſed by mercy, drives the ſoul from God, keeps up impenitency, and hardens the heart againſt all help and hope.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, Certainly <hi>there is no work of grace in ſuch perſons;</hi> they are ſtill in their ſins, under the power and dominion of them, in a dead and unconverted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">There is no work of grace in them.</note> without the Spirit and the life of Chriſt: For where renewing grace is wrought in the heart, there is alwayes an heart of fleſh, a ſoft heart, a plyable heart; the heart is brought in and made willing, and obedient, and ready, and ſerviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: Now a graceleſs condition is a moſt miſerable condition.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Certainly theſe people <hi>are out of Covenant;</hi> God is not their God, nor are they his people: For God doth give unto all his people in Covenant an heart <note place="margin">They are out of Covenant.</note> of fleſh <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a ſoft and tender heart: Now remember that as it is our only happineſs to have God to be our God <hi>(Bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord)</hi> ſo it is our greateſt miſery to be none of the people of God, not to have the loving God to be our God, not to have the merciful God, the pardoning, bleſſing, comforting, ſaving God to be our God.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It cannot but be a moſt <hi>dreadful and reproachful frame of heart,</hi> To be at an utter incompliance with God, and contradiction unto his will; his will <note place="margin">They are at an u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>What would you think of that Child, or of that Servant who caſts off all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of a Father, or of a Maſter, and will not own their commands, but will ſet up their own wills againſt their wills! Mal 1. 6. <hi>If I be a Father, where is my honour? And if I be a Master, where is my fear?</hi> So what ſhould we think of thoſe men, but as of a company of Atheiſts, who will not acknowledge the Lord God, and will not obey his voice, but reject his Word, and deſpiſe his Counſels!</p>
                        <p>Fouthly, It ſeems to be <hi>a very hopeleſſe and deſperate condition,</hi> and ripe for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when no word of God doth a man any good, and no bleſſings do him <note place="margin">It is a hopeleſs condition.</note> any good, and no afflictions do him any good, but ſtill he goes on in his wickedneſs, ſtill he refuſeth Chriſt, ſtill he is unmoved and unperſwaded; why! what will the end of this man be at the laſt!</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Although <hi>nothing doth this ſinner good, yet he muſt be accountable to God</hi>

                        <p>Sixthly, A ſinner that is deſtitute of all ſpiritual ſoftneſs and tenderneſs, he is <note place="margin">He is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of every temptation.</note> in <hi>danger of the powerful efficacy of every great temptation,</hi> which may eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon an heart void of Spiritual tenderneſs.

                        <p>Firſt, If you have hearts Spiritually ſoft and tender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this will appear by the <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and behaviour of your heart towards ſin.</hi> v. g. <note place="margin">The diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our hearts towards ſin.

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Shame for ſin;</hi> one of a ſoft heart is aſhamed of ſin, and for ſin, as one who is aſhamed of any deformity in his body, or of any thing that is a reproach and diſhonour unto his name: Ezra 9. 6. <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face unto thee my God; for our iniquities are increaſed over our heads, and our treſpaſſes are grown up to the heavens.</hi> Here are two expreſſions directly contrary to thoſe in hardned ſinners, mentioned <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed abominations? Nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh:</hi> But ſoft-hearted ſinners are aſhamed, and they do bluſh for ſhame that they have offended their God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 10. <hi>Surely after I was turned I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; and after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh; I was aſhamed, yea even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> In the former place there was ſhame and bluſhing; in this place there is ſhame and confuſion: <hi>Ephraim</hi> was aſhamed and confounded for the reproach of his youth: Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>(i. e.)</hi> amazed, knew not what to ſay, or do, could not open his mouth; O ſuch a ſinner hath ſinned againſt God! <hi>Job</hi> 7. 20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men!</hi> Luke 18. 13. <hi>The Publican standing afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven, but ſmote upon his breſt, ſaying, God be merciful unto me a ſinner!</hi> One that is aſhamed, keeps a loof off, looks with a dejected countenance, and is angry and vexed with himſelf for doing what was unworthy, and reproachful, and would fain have his offence and reproach wiped away: Thus was it with the Publican (and thus is it with every ſoft-hearted perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) he doth by reaſon of his ſinning judge himſelf unworthy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to draw near to God, or to look up unto him; he is aſhamed of what he hath done; dejected, vexed troubled at his ſins which are appearing with him before God, and earneſtly begs the Lord to remove them out of his ſight by a merciful forgiveneſs, that his ſhame may appear no more.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Grief for ſinning:</hi> A ſoft and tender heart is a mournful and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful <note place="margin">Grief for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note>

                           </gap>cted heart, and a weeping and lamenting heart. A perſon of a ſoft heart mourns more for one ſin, than a hardened perſon doth for all his ſins; how bitterly did <hi>Peter</hi> weep for his one ſin! yet <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi> never mourned for his many ſins; a perſon of a ſoft heart mourns more for one ſin, than for all the afflictions that ever have or ſhall befall him; <hi>dolore appreciationis, &amp; dolore voluntatis, &amp; dolore perennitatis &amp; durationis.</hi> He that hath a ſoft heart, mourns and grieves</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For <hi>his own ſinnes:</hi> Ezek. 7. 16. <hi>They that eſcape of them, ſhall eſcape, and ſhall be on the mountains like Doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. David</hi> that man of a ſoft heart, how mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for his ſin! <hi>My ſin is ever before me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 3. <hi>I water my couch with my tears,</hi> Pſal 6. 6. Thoſe in <hi>Zechary mourning as one mourneth for his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon;</hi> And <hi>in bitterneſſe as one that is in bitterneſſe for his firſt born,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> weeping and <hi>waſhing the feet of Chriſt with her tears,</hi> Luke 7. 38. <hi>Peter remembred the words of Jeſus, who ſaid unto him, Before the cook crow twice thou ſhalt deny me thrice; and he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Mat. 26. 75. The <hi>Penitent Corinthian,</hi> ſo mourning for his ſin, that <hi>Paul</hi> writes unto the Church, by all means to forgive and comfort him, <hi>leaſt he ſhould be ſwallowed up with over much ſorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 7. Now by the way obſerve, that perſons whoſe hearts have been really ſoft and tender, they have mourned not only for their groſs ſins, but alſo for their leſſer ſins; not only for corporal ſins, but alſo for their ſpiritual ſins; for pride, hypocriſie, vain-glory, unbelief; not only for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſins, but alſo for inward ſins; not only for the ſins in life, but alſo for their ſins in heart; for the ſin of nature (original ſin) and the ſecret moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof; not only for his ſinful doings, but alſo for his ſins which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his beſt doings; not only for the ſins which they have committed alone, but alſo for the ſins which they have cauſed others to commit, either by their perſwaſion, or by their evil example: Not only for their ſins of knowledge, but alſo for their ſins of ignorance, as he prayed, Lord forgive me my known ſins, and Lord forgive me my unknown ſins; ſo, &amp;c. not only for preſent ſins, but for ſins long ſince committed and pardoned.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>For the ſins of others,</hi> as well as for his own ſins: Pſal. 119. 136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy law.</hi> Ezek. 9. 4. <hi>Go through the mid'ſt of the City, through the mid'ſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the mid'ſt thereof.</hi> Jer. 13. 17. <hi>If you will not hear it, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride.</hi> Exod. 32. 31. <hi>Oh this people have ſinned a great ſin, and have made them Gods of gold!</hi> Luke 19. 41. <hi>When he came near, he beheld the City, and wept over it.</hi> The ſins of others do grieve the Lord; <hi>(Fourty years long was I grieved with this generation,</hi> Pſal. 95. 10.) and diſhonour him; and how can a tender heart endure to ſee his God and Father grieved and diſhonoured, but his ſoul muſt grieve and mourn, be afflicted and troubled! <hi>Paul</hi> reproves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> becauſe they grieved not for the ſin of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Fear to ſin:</hi> True tenderneſs of heart alwayes breeds the greateſt care to pleaſe God, and the greateſt fear to diſpleaſe God: where there is no <note place="margin">Fear to ſin.</note> fear to ſin, there is no tenderneſſe of heart; and where there is true tenderneſſe of heart, there is an exceeding fear to ſin againſt God: <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 17 <hi>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi> Act. 9. 31. <hi>The Churches walked in the fear of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is one who ſets out ſeven degrees of fear, which are to be found in every truely tender-hearted child of God. <hi>viz.</hi>

1. He is <hi>afraid to commit groſſe ſinnes,</hi> though never ſo ſecretly, as you finde in <hi>Joſeph</hi> when tempted by his Miſtris; O ſaith he, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe and ſin againſt God!</hi> Gen. 39. 9. And in <hi>David</hi> when he was ſtrongly tempted to take revenge of his mortal enemy, and had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo put into his hands, yet he durſt not do it, and why, becauſe he durſt not ſin againſt God! <hi>Who can stretch forth his hand againſt the Lords Anointed, and be guiltleſs!</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 9.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He is <hi>afraid to commit little ſins:</hi> what a ſmall matter had it been for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and the <hi>three children</hi> being brought into <hi>Babylon,</hi> to have eaten of the meat, and to have drunk of the wine which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> appointed for them? but <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw it was ſuch meat as was contrary to the Ceremonial Law then in force, and therefore he would not defile himſelf with it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. He is <hi>afraid to omit the leaſt duty: Moſes</hi> was commanded to fetch the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with their cattel and ſubſtance out of <hi>Egypt: Pharaoh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for the people and their little ones, but he would have the Flocks and Herds ſtayed; by no means ſaith <hi>Moſes, Our Cattel alſo ſhall go with us; there ſhall not an hoof be left behind,</hi> Exod. 10. 24, 26. So in the ſetting up of the Tabernacle, and in all other Services commanded by God, he was faithfull in all things, he durſt not leave out one knop, not one tach, not one pin which the Lord preſcribed about the Tabernacle, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. He is <hi>afraid to ſerve the Lord careleſly and negligently: Awake Pſaltery and Harp, I my ſelf will awake early,</hi> Pſal. 108. 2. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee,</hi> Pſal. 119. 10. <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſſe, fervent in Spirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 11.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. He is <hi>afraid to do any thing that is of evil report,</hi> which though in itſelf it may be lawful, yet if advantage may thereby be taken to cauſe Religion or the profeſſion to be reproached and evil ſpoken of, he is afraid to do that thing: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Dare any of you having a matter againſt another, go to Law before the unjust, and not before the Saints?</hi> And why might they not do ſo, what unlawfulneſſe was there in that? Is not civil Magiſtracy ordained of God? 'tis true; but though all <hi>things are lawful, all things are not expedient,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 12. At that time ſuch applications would have expoſed the Chriſtian Religion and Profeſſion unto ſcorn and contempt amongſt unbelievers, &amp;c. <hi>Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God;</hi> he ſpeaks it concerning things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, 1 Cor. 10. 32.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. He <hi>is afraid</hi> not only of apparent evils, but <hi>alſo of the appearance of evil.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22. <hi>Abſtain from all appearance of evil;</hi> if it hath the look or ſhew of evil, it is enough to a tender heart to avoid it, and abſtain from it. If it looks like pride, if it looks like unchaſtity, if it looks like unbefitting ſervice of God, if it looks like perſecuting of the Goſpel, &amp;c. like error, idolatry, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. He <hi>is afraid</hi> not only to do any thing that is evil <hi>(Let not any iniquity have dominion over me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 133.) nor only to ſpeak any evil <hi>(Set a watch O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips,</hi> Pſal. 141. 3.) but alſo to <hi>think any thing that is evil: Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy ſight,</hi> Pſal. 19. 14. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart; the ſeventh year, the year of releaſe is at hand; and thine eye be evil againſt thy poor brother, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in his heart.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> 31. 26. <hi>If I beheld the Sun when it ſhined, or the Moon walking in brightneſs.</hi> ver, 27. <hi>and my heart hath been ſecretly entiſed, or my mouth hath kiſſed my hand, &amp;c.</hi> You ſee by all this, that where there is true ſoftneſs or tenderneſs of heart, there is a ſingular fear to ſin againſt God, or to offend him.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Zeal againſt ſin:</hi> A ſoft and tender heart is a zealous heart; a heart <note place="margin">Zeal againſt ſin.</note>
                           <pb n="570" facs="tcp:55323:301"/>
earneſtly and inflamedly ſet againſt ſin; not coldly and faintly, but ſtoutly and couragiouſly; And that</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Against our own ſins:</hi> a perſon of a tender heart is zealouſly carried againſt his own ſins; which appears thus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>By the impartial oppoſition of them;</hi> he will not hide and ſpare any one ſin in himſelf, neither pleaſant nor profitable, nether great nor ſmall, neither open nor ſecret, but he <hi>hates every falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 119. yea he hates <hi>all vain thoughts,</hi> and cleanſeth himſelf from <hi>all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>By the deep and deadly perſecution of them:</hi> It doth not ſuffice that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allows and condemns ſin in reſpect of his judgement, not that he abſtains from ſin in reſpect of his practice, but he ſtrives after the utter extirpation of ſin; He layes the <hi>Ax to the root of the tree,</hi> Matth. 3. 10. <hi>Crucifies the fleſh in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. <hi>And mortifies the members of ſin,</hi> Col. 3. 5.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By the <hi>Irreconcilable reſolution againſt them;</hi> He will never admit of league, or friendſhip, or have any peace with them, but loaths and hates, and reſiſts, and conflicts, and fights with them all his dayes; and if at any time he be ſurprized and foiled, he riſeth again and renews the war more firmly againſt them, by calling in all the helps and powers that make againſt his ſins; the power of Chriſt, and the power of the Spirit, and the power of the promiſes, and the power of grace.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. By <hi>cutting off all the Succors of ſin,</hi> in occaſions and temptations, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times denying himſelf the uſe of lawful things, leſt by them he ſhould be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally overcome by ſin.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. By <hi>watching his deceitful heart,</hi> and binding it with ſpecial vows and Covenants from ſtarting aſide, and hearkning unto ſin in the motions of it any more.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Againſt the ſins of others.</hi> A ſoft and tender heart would not ſin itſelf, nor would that any other ſhould ſin againſt God, and offend him, and therefore (in a proportion to its ſphere) it will act againſt ſin whereſoever it finds ſin: Sometimes by <hi>entreating,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> unto the men of <hi>Sodom, I pray you brethren do not ſo wickedly,</hi> Gen. 19. 7. Sometime by <hi>directing: Judah</hi> ſaith unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>What profit is it if we ſlay our brother, and conceale his blood?</hi> Gen. 37. 26. <hi>Come and let us ſell him to the Iſhmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our fleſh; and his brethren were content,</hi> ver. 27. Sometimes by <hi>reproving,</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> to <hi>Ahad; I have found thee, becauſe thou haſt ſold thy ſelf to work evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> 1 King 2. 4. And <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, thou art the man,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 7. and <hi>Job</hi> to his <hi>wife; thou ſpeakeſt as one of the foliſh women ſpeaketh, ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> Job 2. 10. Sometimes by <hi>vuthoritative oppoſing</hi> and <hi>puniſhing, domeſtically</hi> in the family, as <hi>David:</hi> Pſa. 101. 7. <hi>He that worketh deceit ſhall not dwell within my houſe; he that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight. Publique</hi> in the ſtate, and for this remember three admirable inſtances of zeale againſt ſin by godly perſons of publique place and authority.</p>
                        <p>The firſt in <hi>Aſa,</hi> who <hi>removed Maacha his Mother from being queen, becauſe ſhe had made an idol in a grove,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 16.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond in <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who <hi>burnt all the veſſels made for Baal, and put down the idolatrous Prieſts, and Groves, and brake down the houſes of the Sodomites, defiled Topheth, beat down all their Altars, and high places, and images, and all old reliques of I dolatry.</hi> The third in <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> See the hiſtory of his zeal, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 15. <hi>In thoſe dayes ſaw I in Judah ſome treading wine-preſſes on the Sabbath, and bringing in ſheaves, and lading Aſſes, as alſo Wine, Grapes, and figs, &amp;c. and I teſtified againſt them in the day wherein they ſold victuals &amp;c.</hi> ver. 17. <hi>Then I contended with the Nobles of Judah, and ſaid unto them, What evill thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day?</hi> ver. 21. <hi>I teſtified againſt the Merchants and ſellers, Why do ye lodge about the wall? if you do ſo again I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.</hi> ver. 23. <hi>In thoſe dayes alſo ſaw I Jews that had married wives of Aſhdod, of Ammon, and</hi>
                           <pb n="571" facs="tcp:55323:301"/>
                           <hi>of Moab.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>And their children ſpake half in the ſpeech of Aſhdod, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 25. <hi>And I contended with them, and curſed them, and ſmote certain of them, and pluckt off their hair, and made them ſwear by God, ye ſhall not give your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto their ſons, nor take their daughters to your ſons, or for your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Special cares, and requeſts to be kept, and bleſſings when kept from ſin:</hi> Pſal. 18. 23. <hi>I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> Job 31. 1. <hi>I made a covenant with mine eyes, why then ſhould I look upon a maid?</hi> Pſal. 39. 1. <hi>I ſaid I will take</hi>

                           <hi>heed unto my wayes, that I ſin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me.</hi> Pſal. 119. 11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my heart that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Pſal. 119. 133. <hi>Order my ſtep; in thy Word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me;</hi> and ſo for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing when kept from ſin. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32. <hi>David ſaid to Abigail, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who ſent thee this day to meet me.</hi> ver. 32. <hi>And bleſſed be thy advice, bleſſed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging my ſelf with mine own hand:</hi> So when the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> and <hi>an halfe</hi> returned, the reſt <hi>bleſſed God that they were kept from ſinning,</hi> Joſh. 22. 33.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Reſtleſneſſe under the commiſſion of ſin, and importunity for the pardon</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Reſtleſtneſſe under the commiſſion of ſin.</note> 
                           <hi>of it,</hi> and the teſtimonies of Gods reconciled favour. O how doth the tender heart take on, and judge, and condemn it ſelf, if at any time it fall into ſin! O what a fool! what a beaſt! and why have I dealt thus with my God! why did I deal ſo unkindly with my kind God? is this my love unto him? is this my fear of him? is this my tenderneſs of his glory? O my ſoul! what haſt thou done! why haſt thou broken the bonds of friendſhip! what hath the Lord been to thee, that thou haſt thus ſinned againſt him! And now the man falls a weeping, and lamenting, as if his heart would break; and after ſome reſpite he thinks of his father again; but he is aſhamed to come to him, and yet he will go to him and return with weeping and ſupplications: O I cannot live thus, I will home again to my fathers houſe, and ſay, <hi>I have ſinned, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon,</hi> Luke 15. Though <hi>ſhame and confuſions belong to me,</hi> yet <hi>mercies and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him;</hi> Dan. 9. <hi>O Lord, heal my backſlidings,</hi> and forgive my backſldings, and <hi>reoeive me graciouſly,</hi> Hoſe 14. 2. And return again in mercy, and <hi>make thy face to ſhine upon thy ſervant for the Lords ſake!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus have I opened unto you the firſt Character or evidence of a heart ſpiritually ſoft and tender; it is a heart filled with ſhame for ſin, and with grief for ſin, and with fear to ſin, and with zeal againſt ſin, and with care to be kept from ſin, and with reſtleſtneſs till it can find God mercifully pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin! O that ſuch tenderneſs, and that ſuch fruits of tenderneſs might be found in all our hearts!</p>
                        <p>Secondly, A ſecond Character by which we may know that we have the true <note place="margin">The activity, and life, and power in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> ſpiritual ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of heart, is the <hi>activity, and life, and power in conſcience;</hi> when God gives any one a ſoft and tender heart, he gives him a conſcience arrayed and enabled with other qualities and powers than in times paſt. The Conſcience heretofore was aſleep, but now it is awakned; hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was blind, but now it ſees; heretofore it was ſilent, but now it ſpeaks; heretofore it was looſe and large, but now it is ſtrict and narrow; heretofore it was dull and weak, but now it is quick and powerful; heretofore it was ſtupid and ſenceleſs, but now it is apprehenſive and active: But I muſt not ſpeak of all things about this; that which I will pitch on, is this, the ſpeciall Activities of Conſcience (where the heart is indeed tender)</p>

<pb n="572" facs="tcp:55323:302"/>
nor to venture all upon falſe bottoms and grounds of ſalvation and damnation, of favour and wrath. O, ſaith Conſcience, thy ſoul is immortal and is for eternity, and there are wayes to that eternity of Gods making, and of mens making; there is a reall relation to Chriſt, and there is a ſeeming relation to Chriſt; there is the power of godlineſs, and there is the form of godlineſs; there were virgins with oyle, and there were virgins with lamps only; there are ſome which believe and are ſaved, and there are ſome that believe but for a time, and periſh: If a man miſtake himſelf, he is undone for ever; hereupon it is, that Conſcience in tender hearts dares not take up the eſtate of the ſoul upon truſt, and proud confidence, and vain pretences, or common grounds, or every appearance, but puts them on, and makes them to ſtudy the Word of God, and to prove what is the good and acceptable will of God, and what indeed are the marks which do accompany ſalvation; what are the infallible tokens of life, of union with Chriſt, of the new creature, of a child of God born of the Spirit; it cauſeth us to ſearch our hearts, and try our wayes, to prove and examine our ſelves whether Chriſt be in us of a truth, to give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure, and to work out our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with fear and trembling; it will not ſuffer us to be careleſs, ſluggiſh, dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, delaying, &amp;c. Conſcience takes thoſe ſaving promiſes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ord as unqueſtionable, that a man muſt believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that will be ſaved, and that he muſt repent that will have his ſins pardoned, and that he muſt be regenerated and born again who will enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And hereupon Conſcience puts us on (if our hearts be tender) exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make clear and evident the aſſumption: I do truely believe, I do truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, I am born again, and my ſins are pardoned, and my ſoul ſhall be ſaved. A tender heart would be ſure that it is in a ſtate of life and favour.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Where the heart is tender, there <hi>conſcience is alive,</hi> in reſpect of the particular facts of our lives whether good or evil.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>good actions</hi> which concern us in our places and callings, Conſcience puts us upon the careful and ſincere practice of them, will not ſuffer us to omit and neglect them, but enclines and hearkens unto them, although danger and trouble be incident unto us for the performance of them: <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>But Peter and John anſwered and ſaid unto them, Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>For we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard.</hi> Act. 21. 13. <hi>Then Paul anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What mean you to weep and break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to dye at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Joſh. 24. 25. <hi>If it ſeem evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerve, whether the gods which your fathers ſerved, that were on the other ſide of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whoſe land ye dwell; but as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For <hi>evil actions,</hi> Conſcience puts forth itſelf againſt them, partly by <hi>warning,</hi> It is evil if thou do it not; partly by <hi>threatning,</hi> It will be bitter unto thee, it wlll deceive thee, and break thy peace and confidences; partly in ſtriving with us, and preſenting argument upon argument, conſideration upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Gods favour on the one hand, and Gods diſpleaſure on the other hand: the happineſs of walking uprightly, the ſhortneſs of ſins deceitful pleaſures, &amp;c. and all to keep us from ſinning; which if they prevail not, then Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be unquiet, and it ſmites for ſinning, and accuſes, and condems, and <note place="margin">The reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſs of our hearts to the Word of God.</note> troubles, and vexes, and will never be quiet untill repentance be renewed, and God appears to be pacified.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If we have hearts ſpiritually ſoft and tender, this will appear by <hi>the respectiveneſs of our hearts to the word of God.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="573" facs="tcp:55323:302"/>
And there are ten Properties of a tender heart in relation to the Word of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It ſets <hi>up the Word as a Light and Rule:</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths.</hi> ver. 133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy Word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It <hi>ſtudies the Word, and meditates therein,</hi> to underſtand the mind of God concerning it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 15. <hi>I meditate in thy precepts, and have reſpect unto thy ways.</hi> ver. 148. <hi>Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy Word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It <hi>layes up and gives ſpecial heed unto what God ſaith in his Word:</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of Propheſie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</hi> Pſal. 119. 11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid within my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Prov. 7. 1. <hi>My ſon, keep my words, and lay up my commands with thee.</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>It ſtands in awe of the Word:</hi> Pſal. 119. 161. <hi>My heart ſtands in awe of thy Word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is <hi>led and guided by the Word: Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel,</hi> Pſal. 73. 24. <hi>Thy teſtimonies are my delight and my counſellors,</hi> Pſal. 119. 24. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and follow me,</hi> Joh. 10. 17.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It <hi>keeps cloſe to the Word in all matters of faith and practice;</hi> receives all, and admits no more; will not go without it, and dares not ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It <hi>conformes itſelf unto the Word: Teach me O Lord the way of thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and I ſhall keep it even to the end,</hi> Pſal. 119. 33. <hi>All that the Lord hath ſaid, will we do and be obedient,</hi> Exod. 24 7. <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keep thy ſtatutes!</hi> Pſal. 119. 5. <hi>He will teach us his wayes, and we will walk in his paths,</hi> Iſa. 2. 3. <hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ye were delivered,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. Moulded, caſt.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It is <hi>quickly reduced,</hi> wrought upon, and recovered by the Word: As in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, when <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 7. <hi>David</hi> ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Nathan, I have ſinned against the Lord,</hi> ver. 13. So <hi>Judges</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Ye have not obeyed my voice; why have you done this?</hi> ver. 4. <hi>And it came to paſſe when the Angel of the Lord ſpake theſe words unto all the children of Iſrael, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lift up their voice and wept.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>And they called the name of that place weepers Bochim, and they ſacrificed there unto the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. It will <hi>often review</hi> and <hi>try itſelf by the Word,</hi> leſt it hath ſinned, or leſt it ſhould ſin againſt God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 6. <hi>I communed with my own heart, and my ſpirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> Pſal. 119 59. <hi>I conſidered my wayes, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. It deſires and endeavours to <hi>comply with all the Word of God,</hi> and to fulfill all the will of God, and to walk according to it in all things: <hi>I have lived in all good Conſcience unto this day,</hi> Act. 23. 1. <hi>We truſt we have a good conſcience,</hi> Heb. 13. 18. <hi>I have reſpect unto all thy commandements,</hi> Pſal. 119. 6. <hi>Zachary and Elizabeth walked in all the Commandements and Ordinances before the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luke 1. 6.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If we have hearts Spiritually ſoft and tender, this will appear by <note place="margin">By our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Gods honour or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour.</note> our <hi>ſenſibleneſs</hi> and choice behaviour in the caſes of <hi>Gods honour and diſhonour:</hi> This I think is one of the fulleſt diſcoveries of a ſoft and tender heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will inſiſt the more upon it by ſhewing unto you,</p>

A perſon of a tender heart <hi>makes conſcience of duties both to God and to men,</hi> not only of duties unto God, nor only of duties unto men, but of the duties which he doth repectively owe unto them both: <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</hi> Mat. 22. 21. <hi>Render therefore to Ceſar the things which are Ceſars, and unto God the things which are Gods.</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. <hi>The grace of God teacheth us to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Mar. 12. 29, 30. <hi>The firſt of all the Commandments is, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy minde and with all thy ſtrength.</hi> verſe 31. <hi>And the ſecond is like, namely this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Many plead a conſcienciouſneſs of duty unto men, they dare not but deal juſtly, and ſquarely, and honeſtly; and yet they make no conſcience of duties unto God; no conſcience of praying, of keeping the Sabbath, of fearing an oath, of walking holily; and many pretend a conſcienciouſneſs of duty unto God, but yet they make no conſcience of duty unto men; they dare to revile, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole, and to oppreſs, and rob a man of his right, and to ſlander and reproach: Neither of theſe are perſons of ſoft and tender hearts, but of deceitful and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical hearts, who fear not God, and follow not him, but their own luſts; A perſon of a tender heart indeed, dares not with-hold from God what is due to God, nor from man what God requires to be done in way of duty unto man: but as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſubjection unto powers ordained of God, <hi>That it muſt be for conſcience ſake,</hi> Rom. 15. 5. ſo ſay I of a tender heart, it performs duties to God, and duties to man, even for conſcience ſake; it dares not defraud the one or the other.</p>

                     <p>Now for this I will propound, 1. Some Motives to perſwade you to get a ſoft and tender heart. 2ly. I will ſhew you the way and means to compaſs and enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>1. The Motives to get a ſoft and tender heart.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>poſſibility of getting this heart; God can give it,</hi> therefore it is <note place="margin">Motives. The poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it.</note> poſſible to get it; God can take away the heart of ſtone, and he can give the heart of fleſh. Again, <hi>God hath promiſed to give it,</hi> therefore it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; why ſhould any one think it more impoſſible for God to give any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good which he hath promiſed, then to give any outward good which he hath promiſed? he having as much power, and willingneſs, and faithfulneſs to perform ſpiritual promiſes, as he hath to perform temporal promiſes. Nay once more, <hi>he hath given this ſoft and tender heart;</hi> do you not read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and do you not find in your own experiences many perſons of ſoft and tender hearts? and who but God hath made their hearts ſoft? it was God who ſubdued the pride, and ſtoutneſs, and hardneſs, and rebellion of their hearts; and it was God who made their hearts humble, and ſenſible, and mournful, and teachable, and plyable; is not God as able, as willing, as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful now, as ever he was?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>neceſſity of having this heart;</hi> can you <hi>be ſaved without it?</hi> what will become of an hardened ſinner? of the diſobedient ſinner, of the ſinner <note place="margin">The neceſſity of it.</note> that doth and will walk contrary unto God, that will not hearken unto him; ſhall heaven open to to let him into glory, who will not open his heart to let in grace? <hi>can you be brought into this without it!</hi> if your hearts continue har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, will they not continue unbelieving! and if they continue unbelieving, will they not continue Chriſtleſs! and if they continue Chriſtleſs, will they not continue hopeleſs! Epheſ. 2. 12. <hi>Without Chriſt, having no hope:</hi> For Colloſ. 1. 27. <hi>It is Chriſt in you the hope of glory:</hi> can you <hi>find pardon of your ſinnes</hi> without it? Do you find in all the Bible pardon of ſins either conferred, or promiſed unto the hardened ſinner! wrath and deſtruction are threatned unto unto that ſinner; but mercy and forgiveneſs are promiſed only to the ſoft, and mourning, and tenderhearted penitent. Thus you ſee that there is a neceſſity to get this ſoft and tender heart, if you will be ſaved, if you will have Chriſt, or be Chriſts, and if you will be pardoned. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="579" facs="tcp:55323:305"/>
Thirdly, The <hi>excellency of this heart;</hi> As an hard heart is a baſe heart, ſo <note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it.</note> the ſoft and tender heart is an excellent heart; <hi>Pharach</hi> ſtands upon Record for a hard heart, and it is his infamy as long as the world laſts. And <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſtands upon Record for a perſon of a tender heart, and it will remain for his glory as long as the world continues.</p>
                     <p>There are five things which are a mans glory and excellency.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One that <hi>he belongs to God in a ſpecial relation,</hi> that God is his Father, and that he is one of the children of God; why! the perſon of a ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart is indeed in this relation; he is in Covenant with God, God is his God and Father, and he is a child of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond, <hi>that he is a new creature;</hi> that new creature is an excellent creature, he is a glorious creature, he is <hi>changed into the glorious image of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>And made partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4.

                     <p>Some that <hi>walk not at all with God;</hi> as all profane Atheiſts, who walk without God, and contrary unto God, by reaſon of the blindneſs and hardneſſe of their hearts.</p>

                     <p>Now ſoftneſs or tenderneſs of heart is a ſpecial means of this upright walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For</p>

                     <p>3. It <hi>lifts up the glory of God;</hi> that is the great end, and aim, and ſcope, and motive to a tender heart; he doth all to the glory of God, and ſo that Chriſt may be magnified.</p>
                     <p>5. It would be <hi>a means of promoting the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and the power of godlineſs, and of caſting down whatſoever is contrary to ſound Doctrine, and unto the wayes of godlineſs; for it would fill the hearts of men with ſpiritual compaſſion to ſouls with zeal, and it would draw out their graces, and gifts, and powers in a right way for God, and for the good and ſalvation of others. If <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> had but as much tenderneſs of heart in relation to the intereſt of God, as to their own intereſt, they would be more quick and active for God than for themſelves; they would juſtifie the righteous, and condemn the wicked; they would countance the faithful in the Land, and contemn the profane; they would honour and exalt the truth of God, and diſgrace and repreſs the errors and blaſphemies againſt God and his truths; they would encourage every godly perſon, and they would appear againſt all open ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Miniſters</hi> had more tenderneſs of heart, they would (in their places alſo) give all diligence to make Chriſt known, and the truths of Chriſt, and contend for them, and oppoſe men of corrupt minds, and that which is Antichriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and they would exceedingly perſwade, and encourage even to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, and to the love of the truth, and to walk in all manner of holineſs and godlineſs: and they would reprove, threaten, warn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the wrath of God againſt all ſorts of wickedneſſe in all ſorts of men.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Families</hi> had this tender heart, they would not ſuffer ignorance and looſeneſs in their dwellings; but on the contrary would ſtudy and take pains to inſtruct and teach their children and ſervants, and would reprove and correct, &amp;c. How would they pray and ſtrive on the behalf of knowledge, and faith, and holineſs, and fear of God, and of walking with God! Verily the whole Land would in a ſhort time, be made an habitation of holineſs, a Land flowing with knowledge, and fear of the Lord, had we more of this tenderneſſe of heart, which would undoubtedly make us more zealous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious for the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>6. It <hi>would be a ſpecial help unto ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> and perſeverance to hold out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <note place="margin">It is a ſpecial help unto ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs.</note> to the end: Jer. 32. 40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> As long as fear holds, ſtedfaſtneſs doth hold; and as long as tenderneſs of heart continues, the fear will continue. Again, where the heart is ſoft and tender, it makes us to be much in Prayer, and diligent and ſerious in our communion with God, and to reſt on his Arm, acknowledging that our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſafety is not in our ſtrength, but in the preſence and influence of his grace.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. He can <hi>make us to ſee,</hi> to <hi>feel,</hi> to <hi>remember,</hi> to <hi>conſider our ſins,</hi> and our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. He can <hi>make the heart mourning,</hi> and <hi>humbling,</hi> and <hi>lamenting:</hi> Zac. 12. 10. <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn, &amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 7. 16. <hi>All of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. He can <hi>put his fear in their hearts:</hi> Jer. 32. 40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts.</hi> And Hoſe. 3. 5. <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. He can make <hi>the heart yielding and plyable</hi> unto his Word and Will: Pſal. 68. 18. <hi>Thou haſt received gifts for men, yea for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell amongst them.</hi> Acts 9. 6. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Jer. 31. 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, You muſt <hi>to his Word,</hi> which is the <hi>hammer</hi> to break, and the <hi>fire</hi> to <note place="margin">Attend the Word.</note> melt the heart: Acts 2. 37. <hi>When they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid unto Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> 2 Chron. 34. 27. <hi>Thou diddeſt humble thy ſelf before God, when thou heardeſt his Word, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But many men hear the Word, and that a long time, and yet their hearts are not at all ſoftned by it; therefore it cannot be a means to ſoften the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is true, that many men do hear the Word, and for many years, and are not ſoftned, but their hearts are more hardned under it; nevertheleſs this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration comes not from the Word, which is a means to ſoften; but from the pride and perverſeneſs of the hearts of men, who do hear the Word, but will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and reject the Word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is alſo true, that though many men have not their hearts ſoftned by the Word: yet many others have their hearts ſoftned by it: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> as although many who take Phyſick, are nothing better by it, yet many who do ſo are reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by it; and this we find by experience, that though the Word be the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death unto death</hi> unto ſome, yet it is <hi>the ſavour of life unto life unto others:</hi> And as we muſt not conclude that the Word is not the means of ſaving faith, becauſe all that hear the Word do not believe; ſo neither muſt we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Word as a means to ſoften the heart, becauſe many who do hear it, do remain hardned; but if we find</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that God hath inſtituted his Word for ſuch a purpoſe and end.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That God hath bleſſed his Word, and made it effectual to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Doth call even ſinners to come and attend, that they may attain that bleſſing depending upon this Word.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, that without the attendance upon the Word, there is no enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that ſoftneſs of heart; but a greater acceſs and confirmation of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. Thence we may confidently conclude, that the Word of God is a means to ſoften the heart: But, </p>
                     <p n="3">3. You muſt know that the <hi>efficacy of ſpiritual means doth not depend upon the meer preſence of the means,</hi> but upon the <hi>concomitancy and influence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> who ſometimes doth put forth his power through thoſe means, and ſometimes doth not ſo. The Word by its own natural and proper vigour, doth not convince, nor convert, nor ſoften the heart (for then every one that hears it ſhould be convinced, and converted, and ſoftned) nor then ſhould it be a means, but a principal efficient; but thoſe effects it doth work on all who hear it, when the Spirit of God comes with the Word unto their hearts in his mighty power, working that grace in us which the Word commands from us: And therefore
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:55323:307"/>
when we come to hear the Word, to have our hearts ſoftned, we ſhould look on the Word as the means; but withall on the Spirit of God as the principal cauſe, who works that effect by the Word; nor ſhould we ever hear the Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpecial prayer and requeſts, that the Lord would by his Spirit make his Word a lively and effectual means of knowledge, of faith, of all grace unto us; and if we did do ſo, the Lord would be found of us, and he would give this ſoftneſs of heart which he promiſeth in his Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you would have ſoftneſs of heart, <hi>you must then get newneſs of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Get newneſſe of heart.</note> 
                        <hi>heart:</hi> Your hearts can never be ſoftned, untill they be renewed; and if they were renewed, certainly they would be ſoftned: The old heart is an hard heart, and the new heart is a ſoft heart. You may as well expect that a dead man ſhould weep, and mourn, and go, and come, as that an old ſinful heart (dead in treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſins) ſhould be a ſoft and mournful heart for ſins, or be willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey the will of God; why! hardneſs in all the cauſes of it, and in all the effects of it, is predominant and raigning in an unconverted graceleſs heart. But if the heart were once changed by renewing grace, then ſoftneſs muſt needs fall into it: Foraſmuch as the change made by renewing grace, brings into the ſoul another nature, quite contrary to our ſinful nature, and other principles quite contrary to all our old principles, Light contrary to darkneſs; and humbleneſſe contrary to pride; and yieldingneſs contrary to ſtubbornneſſe; and ſoftneſſe contrary unto hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if we would have ſoftnſes or tenderneſs of heart, then we muſt <hi>get Faith;</hi> for faith is indeed the foundation of a ſoft and tender heart; and the <note place="margin">Get Faith.</note> more of Faith, the more of tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Faith will ſome ſay?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, a Faith</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Credence,</hi> that God is, that he is a great God, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the Almighty God, the dreadful God, moſt knowing, moſt holy, moſt righteous, and faithful, who will be ſo to us, as his Word reveales him, who will be merciful to the penitent, and will by no meanes cleare the guilty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of <hi>union and complyance</hi> to bring us into Chriſt, and to make us one with him, and to give us fellowſhip with him, and to make us one Spirit with him, and to change us into the glory of his image; if we had this faith, the work were done: Now we ſhould be made like unto him in meekneſs, and humbleneſs, and tenderneſs of heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of <hi>dependence and reliance</hi> upon Gods Promiſes, believing that what he hath promiſed, he will alſo perform; that all his promiſes are Yea and Amen in Chriſt Jeſus; that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him; that he is mindful of his Word, and remembers his Covenant, and will not ſuffer his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to faile; and therefore he will give unto us (humbly ſeeking and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him) this ſoft and tender heart which he hath promiſed. How quickly and eaſily would ſuch a faith prevail with, and obtain from ſuch a Father and God!</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If we would compaſs ſoft and tenderneſs of heart, we muſt then <note place="margin">Get hearts to love the Lord.</note> 
                        <hi>get hearts to love the Lord;</hi> Did we love him, we would be tender of his glory, and tender of his love; tender to pleaſe him, tender not to diſpleaſe him, tender to obey him, and tender to honour him. Joh. 14. 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings.</hi> Love (you know) is of all affections the moſt tender, moſt watchful to obſerve, the moſt carefull to pleaſe, and the moſt fearful to offend: If we did love the Lord, we would not, we could not grieve him. Beſeech therefore the Lord to <hi>circumciſe your hearts, that you may love him;</hi> and conſider the exceeding greatneſs of his love to you, that you may love

                     <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>IN what ſenſe the Spirit is given, or put within the people of God? Sol.</hi> There is a fore fold opinion concerning this. <note place="margin">In what ſenſe the Spirit is ſaid to be put within us. Not to make us one perſon with himſelf.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some have held, that the Spirit is ſo given unto the people of God, as <hi>to make them one perſon with himſelf,</hi> and to communicate unto them his very perſonal propriety; ſo that they in their own perſons, are that perſon in the Trinity which is called the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>This was the deſperate opinion of <hi>Montanus</hi> the Heretick, and I fear ſome wild perſons amongſt us, are of the ſame wicked opinion.</p>
                     <p>But this cannot poſſibly be; becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No Creature is capable to be God, which yet he ſhould be, if he could be the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, for the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt is God: 1 Joh. 5. 7. <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If any man were the perſon of the Spirit, and the very Holy Ghoſt; then 1. He is eternal, for the Spirit is the eternal Spirit: Heb. 9. 14. <hi>Who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And 2ly He is Omnipreſent in every place, for the Spirit is ſo: Pſal. 139. 7. <hi>Whether ſhall I go from thy Spirit.</hi> And 3ly. He is Omnipotent, for the Spirit is ſo: <hi>Who raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> Rom. 1. 4. And quickens, and changeth the hearts of ſinners: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 36. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. And 4ly He is Omniſcient, for ſo is the Spirit: <hi>Who ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. And laſtly, then he might be adored and worſhipped with Divine Worſhip; be prayed unto, be truſted on, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Some do hold, that although the Spirit be not ſo given as to make us one perſon with himſelf, yet he <hi>is given perſonally unto the people of God, (i. e.)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Some ſay he is perſonally given.</note> he is perſonally in them; not only his gifts and graces are in them, but alſo his very perſon is in them; and they do alledge ſeveral places of Scripture to make good this their Opinion: Joh. 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>Even the Spirit of truth.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things.</hi> Joh. 15. 26. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Whence it is thus argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That Comforter which proceedeth from the Father and the Son, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Holy Ghoſt; but that Comforter dwelleth and abideth in us: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt doth dwell in us: 2 Tim. 1. 14. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep, by the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in us:</hi> Hence it is alſo argued; the Holy Ghoſt that keepeth the good gift (or gifts) in, us dwelleth in us; but the Holy Ghoſt which keepeth theſe gifts, is not the gifts, but the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt diſtinguiſhed from them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, and not his gifts only that dwelleth in us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that</hi>
                        <pb n="586" facs="tcp:55323:309"/>
                        <hi>raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Hence alſo 'tis thus argued; the Spirit that dwells in us, is the Spirit that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and ſhall likewiſe quicken our mortal bodies: But it is not the gifts and graces of the Spirit, but the perſon of the Spirit himſelf that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, and that ſhall quicken our mortal bodies. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the perſon of the Spirit himſelf dwelleth in us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Some do hold that the putting of the Spirit within the heart of the <note place="margin">Some ſay it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes only the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſpirit given to us.</note> people of God, denotes only the <hi>donation of the gifts and the graces of the Spirit:</hi> And ſo is the Spirit often taken in Scripture by a Metonymie of the Cauſe for the Effect: <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 15. <hi>He ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb.</hi> Act. 6. 3. <hi>Look you out among you ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghoſt, and of wiſdom.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>And they choſe Stephen a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 1 Theſ 5. 19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit. (i. e.)</hi> the gifts or graces of the Spirit, for the Spirit in himſelf (either Eſſentially or Perſonally conſidered) is not capable of being quenched; there is no abating, or remiſſion, or vacation poſſibly incident unto him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Some do hold that the giving of the Spirit unto the people of God, is only the <hi>letting in of his vigour and aſſiſtance for the works which they are to do;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Some for the letting in of the vigour and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ſpirit.</note> and not any Inherent preſence of the Spirit in the people of God, either as to his perſon, or as to his graces: But as a Bowle moves from that power and ſtrength which the hand lends unto it; ſo do the people of God act and move from the vigorous influence which the Spirit of God puts into them, and not from any inherent principle of grace which they deny to be in them.</p>
                     <p>But this Opinion is not ſound; for the people of God do poſſeſs the Spirit, not only in way of aſſurance to do good; but alſo in way of inward influence to make them good: Therefore they are ſaid to be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> Joh, 5. 6. And <hi>to be waſhed and renewed,</hi> Tit. 3. 5. And <hi>ſanctified by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. which notes an inward change made by the Spirit, and not a bare aſſiſtance only.</p>
                     <p>And beſides here in the Text, the Lord ſaith, that <hi>he will put his Spirit within us,</hi> which certainly is ſomething more than external aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Again, They who do hold the donation of the Spirit as to aſſiſtance only; hold likewiſe free-will to ſupernatural good; that there is in the will of man ſuch a power unto the ſame, that it needs not any renovation by the Spirit; but only the aſſiſtance of the Spirit to that purpoſe, &amp;c. which is a dangerous Error. Well then, the meaning of this expreſſion <hi>(I will put my Spirit within you)</hi> is principally to be <hi>underſtood of the perſon of the Spirit.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">It is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the perſon of the ſpirit.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there are three Reaſons which incline me thus to think.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is, becauſe <hi>the graces of the Spirit were</hi> promiſed before in the 26. ver. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you:</hi> which unqueſtionably takes in the renewing graces of the Spirit; and if in this 27. verſ. by putting his Spirit within us, ſhould be meant only the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then one and the ſame thing only ſhould be promiſed: But this is no way probable or congruous to affirm, <hi>q. d.</hi> I will give you the graces of my Spirit, and I will give you the graces of my Spirit, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, becauſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> here in this verſe promiſed, is <hi>that Spirit which doth cauſe us to walk in the Statutes of God, and to keep them;</hi> which cauſe of ſuch walking cannot well be attributed to any but the Spirit himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Unto which I may add a third, <hi>viz, The uſual way of tryal and evidencing whether we have the Spirit</hi> here promiſed, namely by the graces of the Spirit; which were very improper, if by the Spirit in the place were meant the graces of the Spirit, <hi>q. d.</hi> you may know that you have the graces of the Spirit, if you do find in you the graces of the Spirit. <note place="margin">How it may be demonſtrated.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How may this be demonſtrated, that all the people of God in</hi>
                        <pb n="587" facs="tcp:55323:309"/>
                        <hi>Covenant have the Spirit of God within them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Beſides theſe Scriptures already, produced, which do bear witneſs unto this truth, it may be further demonſtrated thus;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, All that <hi>are Christs, have the Spirit of Chriſt</hi> (for ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> And 1 Cor. 6. 17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit.)</hi> But all who are in Covenant are Chriſts; becauſe all that are in Covenant are believers, and all believers are Chriſts; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that are in Covevant have the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, All that are in Covenant are the <hi>Sons of God;</hi> God is their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they are his ſons and daughters, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. Now ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6 <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, Thirdly, all the people of God <hi>have a fellowſhip and communion with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon of the Trinity;</hi> and ſo high is that fellowſhip, that every perſon of the Trinity doth (as it were) take up his manſion, and make his abode, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them: They have a fellowſhip with every perſon of the Trinity; 1 Joh. 1. 3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 2. 1. <hi>If there be any fellowſhip of the Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> Every perſon of the Trinity dwells and abides in them: Joh. 14. 23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>The Father ſhall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> The Father dwells in us: 2 Cor. 6. 16. <hi>I will dwell in them.</hi> The Son dwells in us: Epheſ. 3. 17. <hi>Chriſt dwells in your hearts by Faith.</hi> The Spirit dwells in us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That all the people of God have the Spirit of God, may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by the <hi>works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And how Chriſt who locally in heaven, ſhould be joyned or united to his Church here on earth; this cannot be done but by the Spirit who doth knit or joyn Chriſt to us, and us to Chriſt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as the head is joyned to the body, and as the body is joyned to the head: But take the inſtance in any particular believer, that Chriſt is his, and he is Chriſts, it is certain; but how comes Chriſt to be his? what is that on Chriſts part which makes this union? it is the Spirit, and none but the Spirit; and what is it on our part which makes this union? it is faith, and it is cauſed by the Spirit: So that the Spirit is neceſſary to this union on either part; on Chriſts part to apply or unite him to us; and on our part in cauſing faith which applyes and unites us to Chriſt: And unto this reciprocal union, the Spirit is ſuch a neceſſary agent, that without him there cannot poſſibly be any union at all: No man can be united to Chriſt, but by the Spirit; neither can Chriſt (I ſpeak it with reverence) unite himſelf to us, but by his Spirit.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, Every one of the people of God <hi>hath but a ſmall portion of the Spirit at firſt;</hi> therefore the grace given us by the Spirit (as to the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it) is compared unto <hi>a grain of muſtardſeed</hi> which is ſowen in the fields, and is the leaſt of all ſeeds; <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 31, 32. unto a <hi>bruiſed reed,</hi> which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak; and to <hi>ſmoaking flax</hi> which is newly kindled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20 and it is called the <hi>day of ſmall things,</hi> in <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>I believe,</hi> ſaid the Father of the child, <hi>Lord, help my unbelief,</hi> Mar. 9. 24. <hi>What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I,</hi> Rom. 17. 15. <hi>And to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not,</hi> ver. 18.

                        <hi>man is moved and ſtirred, and put on, and led, is a falſe ſpirit, and not the Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This may be known many wayes:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A falſe ſpirit <hi>is never let in by the Word;</hi> The Miniſtry of the Goſpel is <note place="margin">It is not let in by the Word.</note> the Channel or the Conduit by which we partake of the true Spirit of God: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Ye received the ſpirit by the hearing of faith (i. e.)</hi> the Word or Goſpel of Faith, as thoſe who hearing <hi>Paul</hi> Preach, the <hi>Holy Ghost fell upon them,</hi> ſo, &amp;c. But a falſe ſpirit comes not in that way, nay it is ſo far from being breathed by the Word, that it works in men a ſlighting and contempt of it, as you ſhall hear preſently.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A falſe ſpirit is <hi>a looſe ſpirit;</hi> perſons that partake of it, do pretend <note place="margin">It is a looſe ſpirit.</note> unto ſtrange Viſions, and high Revelations, and myſterious Notions; but for all them, this falſe ſpirit leaves their hearts unchanged, and their lives unreformed; ordinarily men led by a falſe ſpirit, are unfound and corrupt in their judgements and opinions, and are idle, and lazy, and vicious in their walking.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A falſe Spirit is an <hi>irregular spirit;</hi> the motions and works of it are <note place="margin">It is an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpirit.</note> ſuch, as</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Word of God doth not warrant,</hi> nay doth exceedingly condemn: As for the Husband to take a way the life of his Wife; and the Parent to kill the child; and for a man to take away the goods of his neighbour, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. Neither <hi>a mans General nor Paticular calling can warrant:</hi> The falſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit puts on to ſuch works which a man may not do as he is a Chriſtian, nor may he do as he is ſet in ſuch or ſuch a private Relation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A falſe ſpirit is a <hi>prepoſterous ſpirit:</hi> It fills a man with ſtrange joyes <note place="margin">A prepoſterous ſpirit.</note> and Raptures of heaven, before a man knows Chriſt aright, and receives him by
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:55323:312"/>
Faith, and before he repents of his ſins, or ever made his peace with God; it is all in joy, and nothing in humbling and mourning for ſin.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A falſe ſpirit is an <hi>earthly spirit:</hi> 1 Joh 4. 5. <hi>They are of the world,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">An earthly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> 
                        <hi>therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them:</hi> They talk much of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and ſetting up of that, but they pull down the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt: and it is a temporal kingdom which they ſtrive after, as you may read in thoſe of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, A falſe ſpirt is <hi>a diſordering, and turbulent, and bitter ſpirit:</hi> There <note place="margin">A turbulent ſpirit.</note> are two things which men of a falſe ſpirit have been tumultuouſly, violently rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reviling, and lifting at; One is <hi>Publick Magiſtracy;</hi> the other is <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtery:</hi> It is a certain truth, that the falſe ſpirit, is an enemy to order, and peace, and authority, and likewiſe to ſound teaching, and the inſtituted Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, A falſe ſpirit is a <hi>Scripture-ſlighting ſpirit:</hi> This is evident in all <note place="margin">A Scripture-ſlighting ſpirit.</note> ſorts of men led by a falſe ſpirit: <hi>Papiſts</hi> are more for unwritten Traditions than for the written Word: <hi>Ignorant Formaliſts</hi> are more for ſuperſtitions and ſuperſtitious worſhip, than for the worſhip which the Word of God requires: <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> are more for Revelations and Viſions, than for the Word of God; nay they reject the Word, and do cloſe with them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Eigthly, A falſe ſpirit is a <hi>ſelf-contradicting ſpirit:</hi> It frequently gives itſelf <note place="margin">A ſelf contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting ſpirit.</note> the lye; confidently foretels and determins of matters, and for ſuch particular times, and none of theſe prove true; as I my ſelf know, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, A falſe ſpirit is <hi>a proud ſpirit,</hi> and extreamly impudent and conſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <note place="margin">A proud ſpirit.</note> it ſwells a man up in a conceit of himſelf, and in a contempt of others above all meaſure. The Scriptures are but poor things, and the Apoſtles but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men, and Miniſters but a company of dogs, and others differing from them in their Opinion but the fire-brands of hell, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, A falſe ſpirit is a <hi>preſumptuous ſpirit.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit. Many have the Spirit, yet come ſhorrt of what they ſhould have.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>3ly, <hi>Many have the ſpirit</hi> as to divers gifts, and works, and effects; nevertheleſs theſe do not amount to the putting of the ſpirit within the people of God here promiſed in the Text. <hi>e. g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, A man may be <hi>enlightned by the ſpirit,</hi> he may come into a knowlede of God and of Chriſt, and of the way to heaven, &amp;c. This is the enlightning ſpirit, yet this is not the ſanctifying ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A man may be <hi>gifted by the Spirit;</hi> he may have the gift of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, of memory, of utterance, of praying, of preaching, &amp;c. and yet not not have the Spirit ſpoken of in the Text.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A man may be <hi>humbled by the ſpirit,</hi> he may ſee his particular ſins, be exceedingly diſtreſſed, and terrified, and he may confeſs his ſins (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did) and yet not have this Spirit in the Text.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A man may have deſires of heaven, to be ſaved, as <hi>Balaam,</hi> Let us <hi>dye the death of the righteous,</hi> Numb. 23. 10. and the young man that came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Good Maſter, What ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> Matth. 19. 16. and yet not have, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A man may have many <hi>motions of the Spirit,</hi> to take him off from his evil courſe, to ſtave him off from ſome ſinful action, and to put him on to a new courſe of life; yea ſo far working in him as to raiſe him to ſome kinds of purpoſes and reſolutions (as in hearing the Word, &amp;c.) and yet not have, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, A man may by the ſpirit <hi>taſt of the heavenly gifts,</hi> and taſt the <hi>good Word of God,</hi> and the powers <hi>of the world to come,</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5. he may be joyfully affected (a while) upon hearing, and knowing, and in ſome ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the great happineſs purchaſed by Chriſt, and yet not, &amp;c. <note place="margin">The miſery to be diſtitute of the Spirit.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>4ly, The <hi>extream miſeries</hi> to be <hi>deſtitute of the Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will mention a few of them unto you:</p>

                     <p>All the men in the world are divided 'twixt Chriſt and the Divel; if you be not Chriſts members, then you are the Divels ſlaves.</p>
                     <p>But yet conſider that expreſſion a little more <hi>(none of his)</hi>

None of his in reſpect of <hi>beneficial application;</hi> he is not your Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for Juſtification, he is not your holineſs for Sanctification; he is not your life for Salvation; if you be none of his, you ſhall have none of him.</item>

                     <p>None of his, why! then God is none of yours; then the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are none of yours, then future glory can be none of yours; then the hope of glory can be none of yours; for it is <hi>Chriſt in us the hope of glory,</hi> Col. 1. 27.</p>
                     <p>None of his! then you have no true faith, then you are ſeparated from Chriſt, then you alone muſt anſwer for all your ſins, and then unqueſtionably you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condemnation and curſe of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If you have not the Spirit of God, then are you <hi>dead in your ſins,</hi> you are ſtill in the natural, unregenerate, loathſome and curſed eſtates, like ſo <note place="margin">Are dead in their ſins.</note> many carrions ſtinking in your graves; for it is the Spirit, and he only that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and changeth the eſtate of the ſinner: All ſpiritual life which quickens the ſoul, comes only from the Spirit of life: <label type="milestone">

                        </label> You may as well ſay the body is alive which wants a ſoul, as that the ſoul is alive which wants the Spirit of life: Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly death hath dominion over you (Spiritual death which is a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, and Legal death which is the ſentence of death pronounced againſt you) if you want the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>O what miſery is this to be a ſinner, and nothing but a ſinner! to be totally wicked, to be utterly deſtitute of the glory of God, not any thing of his image in holineſs, in knowledge, in righteouſneſs; not any love of him, not any fear of him, but filled with all unrighteouſneſs, and all ungodlineſs, with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſinful luſts (ignorance, pride, envy, malice, enmity, unleſſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, &amp;c.) and all of them raging and reigning, oppreſſing, and reſiſting, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Why! this is our condition really if we have not the Spirit of God, for there is no change, and there can be no charge from it, but by the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you have not the Spirit of God, than are you <hi>in bondage unto Satan,</hi> and are led and ruled by the wicked ſpirt: There are but two ſpirits which lead all <note place="margin">In bondage to Satan.</note> ſorts of men; either the good Spirit, or the wicked ſpirit; all the ſons of God are led by the good Spirit; and all the children of darkneſs and diſobedience are led by the wicked ſpirit; he moves and ſtirs, and teaches, and inclines your hearts, and leads, and rules, and commands them; and his will you do obey and act all your dayes (though you perceive it not) if you have not the Spirit of God, under that bondage do not continue, for only the Spirit of God is the Spirit of victory, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, of delivery.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, You can never be <hi>bettered by any Ordinance</hi> whatſoever: You may come <note place="margin">Cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> and hear, and go home, and ſay, or read a prayer, thruſt your ſelves upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but all in yain; for what are any of theſe without the Spirit? he can do do good; cannot repent, believe, mourn, why no not any good deſire.</p>

                        </hi> 6. 10, 11. And to prevent erroneous diſobedience, a man needs to know the truth, and to be well grounded in the truth: O but it is the <hi>ſpirit of truth</hi> who <hi>leads us into all truth.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, By opening our ſins (the tranſgreſſion of the Law) unto us: <hi>Rom.</hi>

                        </gap>ght) ſo ſet out a mans ſinful life and heart, that he cannot but confeſs and acknowledge the ſame, and withall, himſelf to lye under the curſe of God, as long as by unbelief he remains in his ſinful eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Whether a wicked perſon may not be convinced of ſin? and if he may, how then can this work of conviction be any diſtinguiſhing character that we have the ſpirit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I do not make every work flowing from the Spirit, a character of his <note place="margin">What are not characters of the preſence of Gods Spirit.</note> gracious preſence; not illumination, not conviction ſolitarily conſidered by themſelves alone, but as concomitantly conſidered with other more powerful and effectual works of the ſpirit following them.</p>
                     <p>2. But ſecondly, there is a difference between that conviction of ſin in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The difference between the convictions of the wicked and the godly.</note> men, and that in the people of God, and the difference lies thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The conviction in wicked men, is ordinarily <hi>levis &amp; mollis;</hi> it is ſuch an evidencing of their ſins, as doth not much afflict and diſtreſs them; indeed they cannot deny but that they are ſinners, yet they hope to eſcape well enough for all this, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The conviction in wicked men is ordinarily <hi>ſemiplena &amp; imperfecta,</hi> it is of ſome outward groſs ſins, as ſwearing, lying, adultery, drunkenneſs; but for all theſe, they think their hearts are as good as the beſt; they are ſeldom convinced their ſinful hearts and natures, and that original ſin which is the fountain of all ſins, and which pollutes the whole ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="597" facs="tcp:55323:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thirdly, The conviction in wicked men if it be full and ſtrong, it is but <hi>Judicialis,</hi> it is not <hi>Remedialis;</hi> it is not <hi>in ſalutem,</hi> but proves only <hi>in pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em;</hi> for when they are ſo convinced, either they ſin more deſperately againſt the convincing light of the Spirit, or elſe they fall into deſpair, as <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Spira,</hi> crying out that their ſinnes are greater than can, or ſhall be forgiven!</p>
                     <p>But now the conviction of ſin by the Spirit in the people of God, is another kind of conviction: For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is deep and powerful, it makes diſcovery of the very root and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">What is the conviction of the Spirit in Gods children</note> of all ſins, even of that corruption and vileneſs in the heart: <hi>In ſinne did my Mother conceive me,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. 5. And I ſee <hi>another Law in my members,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 23. And <hi>Ecce cor meum Deus meus, ecce cor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin!</hi> Ah Lord, what a wicked heart had I? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is graciouſly effectual, this work of conviction works graciouſly upon them, and in an order to Chriſt and their ſalvation by him; for by this they ſee that there is no longer ſtaying or reſting in their ſinful conditions; but then they muſt and will ariſe from their ſleep in ſin: By this they find there is nothing in themſelves for them to reſt upon; for when the Spirit indeed convinceth us of our ſinful condition, as he doth therewith convince us of the curſe and wrath, ſo doth he at the ſame time convince us of our own perſonal impotency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and that there is no help at home; if they are there, they periſh: By this they are occaſioned, and indeed do actually look out for Chriſt, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Peace, and Salvation by him, and in the event come in to him, ſtoop unto all his Precepts, and gladly accept of him and them, and with all their hearts do magnifie and bleſs the grace of God for appointing and ſetting up ſuch a way of life for miſerable, loſt, and ſelf-undone, and ſelf-unable ſinners!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Humiliation; this is another work of the Spirit when he is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Humiliation.</note> us: Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear;</hi> If they had not received it again, then ſometime or other they had received that ſpirit of bondage to fear: Indeed it is a queſtion, whether any who are by faith brought into Chriſt, are under the ſpirit of bondage to fear; but it is (I think) without all queſtion, that the ſpirit of bondage to fear, goes before the <hi>Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father:</hi> And ſo likewiſe is it without queſtion, that humiliation for ſin, or bondage unto fear, is the work of the Spirit; for none but the Spirit of God can work that work within us.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two things in that expreſſion <hi>(the Spirit of bondage to fear)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Whar is the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> which I intend in that outward humiliation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, An apprehenſion and feelling of our preſent ſinful condition (of which we have been convinced) as our bondage or ſlavery, which you know is 1. A baſe and contemptible condition. 2ly A reſtrained and depriving condition. 3ly A ſubjected and ſtooping condition to the will of another. 4ly A labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and toylſome condition, and that upon very hard and cruel terms. 5ly A vexations and grievous condition, even ready to break the heart. 6ly A moſt dangerous condition, wherein our life lies at the mercy of him who hath it in bondage every hour. 7ly It is a moſt weariſome, and burdenſome condition; one would be moſt glad of eſcape and deliverance out of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is with a man who hath received the ſpirit of bondage.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. He looks on his ſinful condition and on himſelf as vile and baſe, and cryes out like the Leper, <hi>unclean, unclean;</hi> like <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am!</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. He looks on himſelf as in priſon, as one ſhut up, and ſhackled and fettered; no liberty, no power to any good.</item>
                        <item>3. He looks on himſelf as fallen into the hands of the living God, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God, who may when he will execute his fierce wrath upon him.</item>
                        <item>

4. On himſelf as a very drudge to ſin, at the command of every luſt, and working out his own damnation.</item>
                        <item>5. He feels this condition full of vexation, and terror, and burdenſome; ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <item>6. And oftimes in the anguiſh of his ſpirit, cryes out, O who will pity, who will deliver me, who will break the bonds of my diſtreſs!</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Secondly, A ſad expectation of evil ſetling upon the ſoul, which is here called fear, for fear is the expectation of evil. The humbled ſinner lying under the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, is farre from jollity, and mirth, and vain confidences; he fears what the holy, and righteous God (who hath <hi>revealed his wrath from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs)</hi> will do unto him for all the ſins of which he is guilty: And he fears exceedingly to dye in this condition; if I dye, I am damned for ever: and he fears to come near to God, he is afraid that God will never look on him, nor anſwer him, nor ſhew him mercy; in a word, he is a very troubled ſinner for what he hath done againſt God, and for what God may juſtly do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But will ſome ſay, Doth every one who receives the Spirit of God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Whether all the godly have firſt the ſpirit of bondage.</note> 
                        <hi>find it thus with him? hath every one the Spirit of bondage to fear?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, every one who hath the Spirit, hath this; thoſe in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. found it thus; <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6. found it thus; the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 29. found it thus; only you muſt diſtinguiſh</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of the intentions and meaſures of it: All that have received the Spirit, have not the like equal meaſure of bondage to fear: Some drink deeper of the cup than others: It is terror in ſome, and burden in others; it is horror in ſome, it is only pain in others; it is the breaking of the bones in ſome, and only the laſh of the rod on others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of the duration and continuance of it: Some are longer under the ſpirit of bondage than others are: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> As ſome women have quicker labour, and others have ſtronger and longer labour: So ſome have a longer time of humiliation for their ſins than others have: Some are under trouble of Conſcience for many years, ſome only a few dayes, and then they meet with Chriſt and are eaſed.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But this work of humiliation cannot be any demonſtrative note of having the Spirit of grace, becauſe many wicked men, living and dying ſo, have had this work of humiliation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Humiliation may be conſidered two wayes.</p>
                     <p>1. As a meere Legal and Judicial work for ſin, as it is a pure retribution of wrath and horror upon the conſcience, and one of the firſt fruits and taſte of deſerved damnation: Thus I grant that a <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> may meet with it.</p>
                     <p>2. As a preparati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e work of the Spirit for Chriſt; thus it is not given to any but to ſuch whom God intends to convert and ſave by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But may ſome reply, There lies the Queſtion; How may one know that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How to know which is true humiliation.</note> 
                        <hi>this work of Humiliation is not a judicial, but a preparative work?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It may (I humbly conceive) be thus known. When humiliation is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative work of the Spirit,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Then the heart is troubled for the filthineſs of ſin, as well as for the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of ſin: Not only becauſe God may puniſh us, but alſo becauſe we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God; not only becauſe I am a guilty ſinner, deſerving and feeling wrath, but alſo I am a filthy and defiled creature, deſtitute of the image and glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Then the heart is broken from ſin, as well as for ſin; ſin troubles me, and I trouble ſin; former ſins are my burden and grief, and preſent ſins is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the object of my hatred; I hate that which hath ſo much provoked God againſt me, and which is the cauſe of all the evil upon me; I will never love nor ſerve it any more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="599" facs="tcp:55323:315"/>
Thirdly, Then all our hopes are in mercy alone, of which we judge our ſelves unworthy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Then it draws out the heart to make after a Chriſt, who only can give peace, and eaſe, and bind up the broken in heart; the Spirit of God leads out this humbled ſinner to Goſpel enquiries, and to Goſpel helpers: As <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30. <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Thus the heart ſtrives earneſtly with the Lord to give Faith, that it may be able to cloſe with Chriſt, and the man is not, and will not be ſatisfied untill he be by faith poſſeſſed of Chriſt? how he prayes; how he hears? how he attends and waits till it be given unto him to believe?</p>
                     <p>3. Union and Conjunction with Chriſt; this is another choice work of the Spirit apparant in all to whom God gives his Spirit. <note place="margin">Union with Chriſt.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the Spirit of God who perſwades, and inclines, and draws in the broken-hearted ſinner unto Chriſt, by him is the match made between the ſoul and Chriſt, by him is Chriſt joyned unto us, and by him are we joyned unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now the Spirit unites, or brings in the humble and broken-hearted ſinner to <note place="margin">How the Spirit unites the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted ſinner to Chriſt.</note> Chriſt on this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By opening the Goſpel (that word of <hi>glad tidings,</hi> and of good news, that good <hi>word of life,</hi> and of hope) unto the humbled ſinner, wherein, as in a glaſs he doth ſee the great love, rich mercy, and free grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt; unto ſuch, who was ſent and given by the Father to ſuffer for our ſins, and to take away our ſins, and to make our peace, and to reconcile us unto God, and to deliver, and ſave our ſouls; and that'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the way to partake of him; and all good by him, is to believe on him; this the Spirit of God makes evident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the humble ſinner, and withall, offers him, that <hi>whoſoever believes on him ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By preſenting ſtrong and ſafe Grounds or Arguments to the humble ſinner, that he ought to believe, and may lay hold for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>v. g.</hi>

                        <item>1. The expreſs command of God: 1 Joh. 3. 23. <hi>This is his command, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, by anſwering and reſolving all the doubts, and fears, and exceptions of unbelief, from the greateſt of former ſinnings, and from preſent unworthineſs, and multitudes of wants; theſe the Spirit inwardly anſwers, and takes off by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the ſinner that Chriſt muſt be his Righteouſneſs, and will be ſo to every one that believes; and that our unworthineſs hinders not, but he that is <hi>athirſt may come and take the water of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>And he that hath no money, he may come and buy wine and milk without money, and without price,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By making the Goſpel (at length) through his own power, an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means of faith; ſo that the humbled ſinner becomes a believing ſinner, his heart is perſwaded and opened to Chriſt, and he glorifies all the goodneſs and kindneſs of Chriſt, he receives and embraces him, takes Chriſt for his Lord,
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:55323:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Saviour, and Husband, and Head, and is joyned unto him, and made one with Chriſt, and Chriſt is one with him.</p>
                     <p>This is the great and notable work of the Spirit, which he works in every one of the people of God in Covenant; not one of them but he is by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit brought in to Chriſt. The Spirit doth not only in a preparative way convince and humble them for their ſins, but alſo he doth in an effectuall manner bring them in to Chriſt, whom he hath before prepared for Chriſt. Therefore let us look well unto our ſelves; by this may you know undoubtedly whether God hath put his Spirit within you. <hi>If his Spirit be in you, then you are in Chriſt.</hi> If the Spirit be in your hearts, then Faith is in your hearts. If you be poſſeſſed of the Spirit, then you are poſſeſſed of Chriſt; your hearts are overcome, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, are drawn to Chriſt; he hath been the great deſire of your ſouls, and he is the very portion of your ſoules: You are Chriſts, and Chriſt is yours.</p>
                     <p>But if your hearts remain ignorant of Chriſt, or undeſirous of Chriſt, and careleſs of Chriſt, and ſtubborn, and oppoſite to Chriſt, you will not have <hi>Chriſt to reign over you;</hi> and you will not come to him though you may have life; and you love your ſins better than Chriſt, and you will ſit down with the pleaſure, and with the profit of the world; aſſuredly you have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; and if you continue thus, you ſhall dye and periſh in you ſins.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Regeneration or Renovation; this is another eminent work of the Spirit extant in all the people of God; they are all of them regenerated, and <note place="margin">Regeneration.</note> renewed by the Spirit: Joh. 3. 5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Tit. 3. 5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It is that work of the Spirit by which we partake of a new ſpiritual being, <note place="margin">What regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is.</note> even of the life of Chriſt, yea of the ſame image of Chriſt, and by which we are made new creatures.</p>
                     <p>As in every natural generation there is (as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſpeak) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a new form; as when the water is turned into aire, or the are is turned into fire, there is ſtill another form, a new form brought into them; or as when a child is generated, there is another new form brought into the matter which it had not before, <hi>viz.</hi> a reaſonable ſoul.</p>
                     <p>So is it in Spiritual Regeneration, there is a new Divine being or quality brought into our ſouls by the Spirit, by which we are Spiritually changed from what we were: Joh. 3. 6. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit:</hi> Look as that <hi>which is born of the fleſh is fleſh:</hi> the ſinner begets a ſinner; and that which is born of the ſinner, it is born after his own ſinful image: In like manner that which <hi>is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> If any man be born of the Spirit, there is the life and holineſs of that quickning and holy Spirit in him; he is not what he was; there is an excellent change wrought in him; he is quite contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not only for converſation, but for inclination; his mind, his judgement, his will, his affections, there is a new principle in every one of theſe; <hi>Old things are paſt away, all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Whether this work of Regeneration or Renovation is in every one of the people of God unto whom the Spirit is given?</hi>

                     </p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Certainly it is: The Spirit is never put <hi>(in medio)</hi> within the heart of any man, but he doth regenerate and renew him: 2 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>We all with open</hi>

                        <hi>face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> Mark it, we are changed by the Spirit of the Lord into the ſame image which we ſee in Chriſt: 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> Nay ſurely, all that ever had the Spirit of God put within them, you ſhall find that they were new creatures; you read it in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 2. in <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9. in the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. in the <hi>Corinthians; Such were ſome of you, but ye are weſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.</p>
                     <p>Therefore conſider well what you were, and what you now are; if there be not a Regeneration, a work of Renovation in you, verily you have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; God hath not put his Spirit within you.</p>
                     <p>If the old ſinful qualities remain and prevail in you, of drunkenneſs, of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of pride, of malice, of hatred of holineſs, of unbelief, of hardneſs of heart; if theſe or any other ſinful luſts continue unmortified, you have not received the Spirit: And if no new qualities contrary unto theſe are to be found in you, if the image of Chriſt, if holineſs, if faith, if love, &amp;c. are not in you in ſome meaſure, you are none of the people of God, you have none of his Spirit within you.</p>
                     <p>For as they ſay of the ſoul of man, the ſoul doth build and frame a houſe fit for itſelf to dwell in, that is moſt true of the Spirit of God; when he comes into our hearts, he doth purge them, and renew them, and make them Temples fit for himſelf to dwell in: Indeed he doth not find us holy when he firſt comes into us; but as ſoon as he comes he makes us holy, and ſanctifies us throughout in ſoul, ſpirit, and body; he fills our Temple with his glory.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Direction or leading: This is another work of the Spirit to be found <note place="margin">Direction is another work of the Spirit.</note> in all who have the Spirit given unto them; <hi>Spiritus Dei docet &amp; ducit:</hi> Rom. 8. 14. <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo (for the words are Reciprocal) <hi>as many as are the ſons of God, they are led by the Spirit of God.</hi> That expreſſion of leading is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken either from blind men, and men in the dark who do need a guide; or from little weak children not able to go alone, and therefore are held and led by the hand: Now concerning this work of the Spirit, I will briefly open two things unto you.</p>
                     <p>1. Queſt. <hi>How the Spirit of God leads the people of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is you know, a twofold leading or guidance of the Spirit. <note place="margin">How the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit leads Gods children.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. One is general, by a common virtue or influence which aſſiſts the creatures in all their powers and faculties to their ſeveral operations.</p>
                     <p>2. The other is ſpecial, by a more high and peculiar influence upon the hearts of men in order to the eſtate, and acts, and wayes of grace and ſalvation: Thus the Spirit of God leads the people of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By way of Irradiation or illumination; he opens the eyes of their minds to ſee the paths and wayes of life, and the will and wayes concerning them; what way the Word reveals, certainly he reveals internally giving light to ſee it: Iſa. 2. 3. <hi>Come and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, and he will teach us of his wayes.</hi> Chap. 20. 21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, By way of inclination: when the Spirit leads, he doth not only ſhew us what good we are to do, but alſo he doth powerfully incline our hearts to comply with, and follow that direction of his; Pſal. 25. 4. <hi>Shew me thy wayes O Lord, teach me thy paths.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Lead me in thy truth.</hi> Iſa. 2. 3. <hi>He will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> The Spirits leading is not a meer Revelation of the will and way of God unto the people of God, as if
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:55323:317"/>
one ſhould point out the way to Traveller, but it is an efficacious perſwaſion, add a ſecret and ſtrange inclination, in enabling to walk in that good way of life revealed by him unto them: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> As a Nurſe leads the child by lending her help and ſtrength unto the going of the child: <label type="milestone">

                        </label> Or rather as the head leads the feet in their motion by letting down an influence enabling thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By way of Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ortation, ſtirring up their hearts, and quickning them to holy ſervices, and to walk according to his motions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Draw me and I will run after thee.</hi> Pſal. 119. 37. <hi>Quicken me in thy way.</hi> Cant. 4. 16. <hi>Awake O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden that the Spices thereof may flow out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Forthly, by way of Cooperation: As the Spirit leads us by inclining our hearts unto good, ſo alſo he leads us by working with us in doing of good: <hi>He worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As when the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to ſhoot the arrow, he did put his hand upon the Bow, and <hi>Eliſha did put his hand upon the Kings hand,</hi> 2 King. 13. 16. So when we are to do any good work, we are to put up our hand, and the Spirit of God likewiſe puts out his hand; he puts his ſtrength to our ſtrength, or rather to our weakneſs; we are to pray, to mourn, to believe, to obey; and that we may do theſe, he comes in with a new influence, help, and power aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us unto all theſe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, by way of Confirmation, ſuſtaining, upholding, carrying us on from path to path, from work to work, untill we have finiſhed all our work; he leads us on in the courſe of holy obedience all the dayes of our life, from firſt to laſt, till we come to our journeyes end: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me unto glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Queſt. <hi>Why the Spirit of God thus leads the people of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Becauſe</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Of our ignorance; we cannot ſee but by his light. <note place="margin">Why Gods Spirit leads Gods people.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Of our own inability or weakneſs; even when ſtrongeſt, their own graces of themſelves alone are not ſufficient ſtrength unto them; which appears in the great falls of the beſt of them, when left but a little unto themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Of the difficulties of their work, and in their way and journey to heaven; their work is very great, and the encounters which meet them are very ſharp; there was a red Sea, and a wilderneſs to paſs through, and ſtrong enemies to be fought with, and conquered before they came to <hi>Canaan.</hi> So is it with Chriſtians in their way to heaven, &amp;c. Thus you ſee that the Spirit of God leads the people of God; he is given unto them for a Guide and Leader, and they do hearken unto him willingly, deſirouſly, carefully, conſtantly, and follow their Leader.</p>
                     <p>But where is this leading work to be found? who amongſt us is led by the Spirit of God? Many</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Are led by their own hearts luſts;</hi> they are at the command of every ſinful motion. Many are led</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>By Satan;</hi> they preſently follow every temptation of his, and his will and works they will do. Many are</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Led <hi>by the world;</hi> by the example of it, they will do as moſt men do; by the faſhions of it, they will not be like no body, but will attire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the world doth; by the pleaſures of it, by the profits of it, as <hi>Balaam</hi> was led for reward even to curſe the people of God. Many are led</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By <hi>their own judgement,</hi> and by their own wills, and they will not be controlled. And many are led</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, By <hi>the ſpirit of error,</hi> and not by the Spirit of truth: They are
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:55323:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>led away with the error of the wicked,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 17. <hi>And follow their pernicious wayes,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 2.</p>
                     <p>If all the men in the world were drawn out and ſtood under their proper Colours and Leaders, how thin, how few would be found to follow this beſt, this only ſafe Leader, the Spirit of God! but remember what the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye;</hi> as it is a ſure ſign of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when we walk <hi>not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. and 4.) ſo it is a ſure ſign of damnation when we walk <hi>after the fleſh, and not after the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus have you the diſcoveries of the Spirit of God by his works: Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the ſecond way of diſcovery by which we may know whether we have the Spirit of God. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2ly By the qualities of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>There are many qualities by which the Spirit of God is ſet forth unto us in ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; <note place="margin">Having the ſpirit, may be known by the qualities of the Spirit.</note> all which (virtually) every one who hath the Spirit doth, or may find in himſelf in ſome meaſure: I ſhould be too tedious if I ſhould diſcourſe upon every one of them, therefore I will fix upon ſome of them, <hi>e. g.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, The Spirit of God is the <hi>Spirit of judgement, and of burning:</hi> Iſa. 4. 4. <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and ſhall have purged the blood of Jeruſalem from the mid'ſt thereof by the Spirit of judgement, and by the Spirit of burning.</hi> In the former verſe God doth make a promſe unto the Reliques of <hi>Zion,</hi> and unto the Remnant of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that they ſhall be holy: In this verſe he declareth when this ſhall be, namely, <hi>In the day when he ſhall waſh them from their filth, and purge them from their blood:</hi> Laſtly, he ſhews how this ſhould be cauſed, and that is <hi>by the Spirit of judgement, and by the Spirit of burning.</hi> Some by the Spirit of judgement do underſtand that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by which God judgeth and puniſheth the wicked; others by it do underſtand, a mind and power given to execute judgement or righteouſneſs for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of the people of God from their enemies, but (with ſubmiſſion) I conceive, that by <hi>the Spirit of judgemen</hi> is meant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And he is alſo <hi>a Spirit of burning;</hi> like as fire to the droſs, which ſeparates it from the mettal, and waſtes and conſumes it: in like manner doth the Spirit work in our hearts a ſeparation from our ſinnes, and a daily mortification of them: Hoſe. 14. 8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I any more to do with idols?</hi> Iſa. 31. 7. <hi>Every man ſhall caſt away his idols of ſilver, and his idols of gold.</hi> Ch. 30. 22.

                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved! as this is one ſpecial end why Lord gives his Spirit unto his people; <hi>viz.</hi> that they may judge and condemn, and mortifie their ſinful luſts, ſo it is (if I may ſo ſpeak) the very <hi>Genius</hi> and natural diſpoſition of the holy Spirit to be caſting out, pulling down, cleanſing, and purging of all our impurities and fleſhly luſts which are ſo contrary to his nature, and ſo offenſive unto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: Hence it is that he maintains a conſtant and perpetual war with ſin in the hearts of the people of God, till at the laſt he gives unto them a compleat and perfect victory.</p>
                     <p>Now from what I have delivered in this concerning the <hi>Spirit of judgement and of burning,</hi> two things will flow.</p>
                     <p>1. A conviction unto ſome, that they have not yet received the Spirit of God; becauſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They have not received the ſpirit of judgement to diſallow and condemn their ſinful luſts and wayes, but are ſo far from it, that on the contrary, they do approve them, and defend them, and ſupport them, and cannot endure to hear the reproof and condemnation of them from the Word, or Miniſtry, or any other, but preſently they rage, and ſwell, and grow diſcontented, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and revengeful.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They have not received the ſpirit of burning to abhor their ſins, and to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them, foraſmuch as they do ſtill love their ſins, and will ſerve them, and will not forſake them, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 13. But their great delight is in their ſinful wayes, and they hold faſt their iniquities, and hate to be reformed; ſurely theſe perſons have never received the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>2. A comfort unto others, that they have received the Spirit of God: Becauſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They do judge themſelves, and really do diſallow and condemn all ſin in themſelves: Rom. 7. 15. <hi>That which I do I allow not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are daily mortifying their ſinful luſts, by ſtriving after a fuller fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the death of Chriſt, by relying on ſin-ſubduing and mortifying promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by conſtant hatred and oppoſition of their luſts which war againſt the law in their mind; ſo that they will not ſerve ſin any more; and though (as the Apoſtle ſpake in 2 Cor. 10, 3.) <hi>they walk in the fleſh, yet they do not warre after the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Spirit of God is the Spirit of knowledge and wiſdom; ſo you read in Iſa. 11. 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and understanding, the ſpirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 17. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</hi> Whoſoever hath the Spirit of God, that man hath wiſdom given unto him by the Spirit; not carnal wiſdom, but heavenly wiſdom, true wiſdome indeed; which wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as to the ſubject; <hi>If thou be wiſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf,</hi> Prov. 9. 12. And herein is a mans wiſdom for himſelf, when he principally minds, and looks after, and ſpends his choyſeſt cares, and layes out his chiefeſt pains to make ſure work for the ſaving of his immortal ſoul. That man is wiſe indeed, and he only is wiſe who ſo attends his ſoul, that he is never at reſt untill he finds his ſoul to be ready in a ſafe and ſound condition: And thus doth every one who hath the Spirit of God given unto him; he is by the Spirit made wiſe unto ſalvation: <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved!</hi> Act. 16. 30 <hi>He work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that which is pernicious and impertinent: And this wiſdom all have who have the Spirit of God: For</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They pitch upon the moſt excellent and moſt neceſſary object to enjoy that; <hi>viz.</hi> God to be their God, and reconciled Father; and Chriſt to be their Lord, and Redeemer, and Saviour. <hi>One thing is neceſſary, and Mary hath choſen that good part, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They abhor ſin, which is the pernicious object: <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Prov. 14. 16. <hi>A wiſe man feareth and departeth from evil.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, As to means and wayes tending to the fruition of eternal bleſſedneſs; Theſe they find out, and in theſe they walk, untill they come and appear before God: Repentance, Faith, Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Love, new Obedience, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, theſe are the vety paths and wayes to heaven, and all theſe do they chuſe and walk in, who have the Spirit of God given unto them: Pſal. 119. 30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth.</hi> Ver. 35. <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, for therein do I delight.</hi> Iſa. 26. 7. <hi>The way of the juſt is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, As to time or ſeaſon: Eccleſ. 8. 5. <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both time and judgement:</hi> And this part of wiſdom alſo is found in all that have the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>There is a day of viſitation, a day of knowledge of the things which <hi>do concern our peace,</hi> Luke 19. 42, 44.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>day of ſalvation,</hi> an <hi>accepted time,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2. A time when Chriſt offers himſelf, and love, and mercy, and happineſs, and ſtrives with the hearts of men to know and accept of him: And this time they who have the Spirit of God, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and do lay hold on, and do gladly embrace; they do not ſlight, nor delay, nor harden their hearts; But <hi>while it is called to day they hearken:</hi> Like the wiſe Merchant, who as ſoon as he found the <hi>pearl of great price, ſold all and bought it,</hi> Matth. 13. 45, 46.</p>
                     <p>Now if this wiſdom of the ſpirit be (as indeed it is) the evidence that we have the Spirit; O how few then have the Spirit of God given unto them! Who takes care in the firſt place for his ſoule, and makes ſure the ſalvation of it! Who ſets his heart upon a God, upon a Chriſt, upon Reconciliation, upon pardoning mercy; and not rather upon his ſins, and on the world? Who knows the day of grace, the day of his viſitation, the day of his ſalvation, the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time! Who chuſe the path of holineſs, the way of uprightneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, The Spirit of God is the Spirit of power; and he is ſuch a Spirit in and unto all unto whom he is given: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18. <hi>The Gentiles were made obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</hi> Ver. 19 <hi>By the power of the Spirit of God.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. <hi>God hath given unto us not the ſpirit of fear, but of power.</hi> Iſa. 11. 2. The Spirit of the Lord is there called <hi>the Spirit of might:</hi> Epheſ. 6. 10. <hi>Be strong in the Lord, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d in the power of his might.</hi> The Spirit of God is a moſt ſtrong and powerful Spirit; and he puts forth a wonderful power in all them unto whom he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>e. g.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, he raiſeth every one of them from the dead; what the Lord ſpake of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> touching their civil eſtate: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. 13, 14. <hi>I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, and will put my Spirit within you, and you ſhall live:</hi> That is true in a ſpiritual ſenſe of all the people of God unto whom the Spirit of God is given: Though before the donation of the Spirit they were dead in treſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="606" facs="tcp:55323:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when the ſpirit is given unto them, they are by the operation of that ſpirit quickned, made alive, and raiſed from that dead eſtate: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> they have the life of God and Chriſt in them: O what a power is put forth in the raiſing of a dead man! and yet there is a greater power of the ſpirit put forth in the raiſing of a dead ſinner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He enables them, both to perceive, and alſo to receive the things of God; to perceive the glory and excellency of them, and to receive the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſweetneſs of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To perceive them: Mat. 13. 11. <hi>It is given unto you to know the myſteries of the kingdom of God; but to them it is not given.</hi> And 1 Cor. 2. 6. <hi>We ſpeak wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom amongſt them that are perfect.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>The wiſdom of God in a myſtery.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>Which none of the Princes of this world know.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>Which are fooliſhneſſe unto the natural man, and which he cannot know, q.</hi> they are <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> Compare theſe places together, and you ſhall find two differences 'twixt them who have the Spirit, and them that have not the Spirit, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of God; <hi>viz</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the one they are wiſdom, yea, and wiſdom of God, but to the other they <note place="margin">Who have, and have not the Spirit.</note> are fooliſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>When we preach Jeſus Chriſt and the things of ſalvation, the new creature, ſelf-denial, living by faith in Chriſt promiſed, &amp;c. and make offers of him unto a people; ſome make light of him, and regard not the offer at all, they ſee no beauty at all in him that they ſhould deſire him: Yet others ſee in him <hi>the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;</hi> and do admire at that infinite mercy, and goodneſs, and love, and life, in and by him; the reaſon is, becauſe the one knows him not; but to the other it is given to know him, and to diſcern the myſtery of ſalvation in him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To receive hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: Joh. 1. 11. <hi>He came amongſt his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>But as many as received him, &amp;c.</hi> And who were theſe that received him; See Ver. 13. Such as were <hi>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. <hi>They that gladly received the Word were baptized.</hi> But 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:</hi> If Chriſt be offered, the natural man will not receive him; If Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that is my Diſciple muſt deny himſelf:</hi> This is a <hi>hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> Joh. 6. 60. <hi>And take up his croſs and follow me;</hi> the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man will not receive this: If the Word ſaith, <hi>Repent and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 19. The natural man will not receive this, nor will he receive that truth in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 41. <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, &amp;c.</hi> But every one who hath the Spirit of God, as he hath a power given to perceive or diſcern the myſteries of the Kingdom of God, and all the wayes and rules belonging thereunto; ſo he hath alſo an heart given to cloſe with the Kingdom of Chriſt, and with every part and path of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Spirit enables them to pray, and under the ſenſe of their wants and troubles to come unto God as their Father, and to open their conditions unto him with judgement, affection, and confidence; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>We have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered.</hi> Here you ſee that they who have the Spirit of Adoption, have received the Spirit of ſupplication, every ſon of God is able to call God Father, and to cry unto him as his Father; and that the Spirit of God is in this work of Prayer by making interceſſion for them, appears, 1. By enabling them to make requeſts for themſelves, <hi>with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> 2. With fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and earneſtneſs of heart.</p>

                        <hi>the Spirit, becauſe many wicked men do pray, and ſo do many hypocrites:</hi> Iſa. 26. <note place="margin">Whether the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be a ſure ſign of a child of God.</note> 16. <hi>Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee, they have poured out a Prayer when thy chaſtening was upon them; Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By way of Conceſſion, granting three things unto wicked men and hypocrites; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. They may and do in their diſtreſſes put forth natural deſires for help, as the very beaſts do under their burdens and wants.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They may, and generally do ſatisfie themſelves with a form of Prayer, which they read, or hear read unto them, which is another thing from the Spirit of Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They may have the gift of Prayer, or an ability to pray by the ſtrength of gifts, and parts; and upon hearing of others, to gather up ſome good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and fragments, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>utter them as if they did pray.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By way of Negation: Notwithſtanding thoſe three Conceſſions, I deny that any man hath the ſpirit of ſupplication, who hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace; becauſe, the ſpirit of ſupplication is given with the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is proper to the ſons of God: Every one who hath the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he can come unto God, and call him Father, which none can do, but ſuch as are in Chriſt, in whom he becomes our reconciled God and Father. To pray with the Spirit of Prayer, is to pray with a ſpecial <hi>(My ſoule is ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> Pſal. 6.) feeling of our wants, and of our <hi>(I am not worthy to be called thy ſonne)</hi> unworthineſs, and the deſires of our ſoul, &amp;c. <hi>(with my whole heart, and my ſoul follows hard after thee;</hi> with affectionate earneſtneſs of heart, and with <hi>(I believe, therefore I have spoken)</hi> confidence towards God in the name of Chriſt, that he will give unto us the good things which he hath promiſed to us in his Covenant, 2 Sam. 7. 27. <hi>Thou haſt revealed unto thy ſervant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe, therefore thy ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> Who can pray thus, but he who is a child of God, but he who hath the Spirit of God, to ſhew unto him his ſpiritual wants, to ſtirre up in him ſpiritual and earneſt deſires to quicken his Faith on God, and to depend on his good and faithful Promiſes in Chriſt! &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I will adde one inſtance more concerning the power in all who have received the Spirit, and that is this; All who have received the Spirit, have received a power to do ſuch works as none elſe in all the world can do; for they are able in the ſtrength and power of the Spirit,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To abhor the deareſt luſts, which have formerly been more unto them than their lives and heavenly happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To forſake Father and Mother, Husband and Wife, and Children and Friends, Houſes and Lands for Chriſt, and an afflicted eſtate with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To prize communion with God, and to take more ſatisfying delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than in all earthly enjoyments whatſoever: But <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me:</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſufficeth us.</hi> Pſal. 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. To live by faith in the times of deſertion <hi>(Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13. 15.) and in times of deſolation when as creature helps and comforts fail; <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vine, and the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, and the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls, yet I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation,</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b. 3. 17, 18. <hi>The Lord God is my ſtrength,</hi> ver. 19.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To be contented in every eſtate, and to comply with it: Phil. 4. 12, 13. and to glorifie God under it: O where is this power of the Spirit of God? where are any great things or works of the Spirit within us? I cannot pray, ſaith one,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:55323:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and I cannot leave my ſins, ſaith another; and I can find and take no delight in God, or communion with him, ſaith another; and I cannot truſt on his Word, nor wait upon his Promiſe, &amp;c. Few men have any Spiritual power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore few men have the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Spirit of God is the Spirit of liberty: 2 Cor. 3. 17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty:</hi> Liberty is a freedom from bondage, or ſlavery; and Goſpel-liberty (which principally reſpects the ſoul) is a freedom accruing unto us</p>
                     <p>Partly by price and purchace, namely by the blood of Chriſt: The Lord Jeſus by his death hath purchaſed many glorious liberties for us; he hath freed us from the Law as it is a Covenant of Works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11, 12. and from the curſe and wrath, ver. 13. and from all condemning power of ſin, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
                     <p>Partly by ſtrength and efficacy; this liberty comes unto us by the Spirit who puts forth a ſtrong and mighty hand upon all the hearts of all the people of God, and reſcues and frees them from ſpiritual ſlavery under which they were held whiles they were in their natural condition.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of God doth free them</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From ſlavery to ſin: See Rom. 8. 2 <hi>The law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the law of ſin and death: (i. e.)</hi> The power of the Spirit hath freed me out of the hands and power of ſin, ſo that it ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and rule over me as heretofore; it is no longer my Lord, nor am I any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his ſervant; I am delivered and freed from the dominion and tyranny of it, and ſervice unto it, by the Law <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the powerful and authoritative command and work of the Spirit: upon this account the Apoſtle affirms, that all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God <hi>are made free from ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 18, 22. they are not in bondage, they are not at the command of it; ſin hath loſt its law and authority in them; the yoke is broken by the ſpirit which is given unto them; ſin indeed will ſtirre, and trouble, and uſurp; but ſlavery unto it is taken away: <hi>Iſa:</hi> 10. 27. <hi>The yoke ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> becauſe of the anointing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From ſlavery to Satan: Before we receive the Spirit of God, we are in bondage unto the Divel, who rules or <hi>works effectually</hi> in us: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>and takes us captive at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. as one that hath a bird tyed, &amp;c. O what power hath Satan over a natural man! how he fetters, and ſhackles, and binds him, and impriſons him, and makes him to drudge in the fulfilling of his motions, and obeying of his ſuggeſtions and temptations! But now when the Spirit of God comes into us, he ſpoiles the ſtrong man armed, and <hi>takes from him all the armour wherein he truſted,</hi> Luke 11. 21, 22. For he is ſtronger than he. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>He leads captivity captive;</hi> he turns us <hi>from Satan unto God,</hi> Acts. 26. 18.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But Satan still tempts and aſſaults! never was man ſo tempted as I am!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Temptation is one thing, and ſalvation is another; he beſtirred himſelf in tempting and we obeyed; he now tempts and we reſiſt.</p>
                     <p>He frees us from him, 1. By making us to abhor his Kingdom. 2ly By tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating us out of his power into the Kingdom of Chriſt. 3ly By arming us with the armour of God againſt his aſſaults. 4ly By ſtirring us up to reſiſt him: <hi>Jam.</hi> 4 7. <hi>Reſiſt the Divel, and he will flee from you.</hi> And 5ly By ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening us to overcome him; 1 Joh. 2. 13. <hi>Ye have overcome the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, From ſlaviſh fear, and a ſlaviſh ſpirit in working; in this reſpect he makes us to <hi>ſerve God without fear,</hi> Luk. 1. 74. that is, without ſervile fear; for there is a twofold fear.</p>
                     <p>There is <hi>Timor filialis,</hi> which is grounded in the love of God as a Father; and there is <hi>Timor ſervilis,</hi> which looks upon God only as a Judge, and hath a reſpect to
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:55323:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fo wrath. Now when the Spirit of God is given unto us, we do not ſerve God tor fear of wrath, and puniſhment, and damnation, but out of love, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ingenuity: Though there were no Law to curſe us; though there were no Conſcience to terrifie us; though there were no Hell to burn us; yet the Lord our God and Father we will love, and him will we ſerve.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, From ſlaviſh indiſpoſitions, as averſeneſs to what is good, and indelightfulneſs in it: They that are anointed by the Spirit and power of God, it makes them ready, and willing out of love, and working out of love.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Spirit of God is a Spirit of truth; Joh. 14. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>even the Spirit of truth.</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </div>
                  <div n="1" type="section">

                     <p>THere are divers ſorts of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which the Spirit is the Authour, and <note place="margin">Divers ſorts of truth of which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.

                     <p>Firſt, The truth of Doctrine, in oppoſition to erroneous and falſe Doctrines: Joh. 17. 17. <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. <hi>Who would have all men to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The truth of Doctrine conſiſts principally in knowing and underſtanding thoſe points and wayes which do teach and guide us certainly unto ſalvation; and this is called the <hi>truth in Jeſus:</hi> Epehſ. 4. 21. And the <hi>truth which is after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> Tit. 1. 1. This truth doth the Spirit teach all unto whom he is given; he makes them to know the Word of truth, and which is the way of life; he builds them upon Chriſt, and roots them in Chriſt who is, Joh. 14. 6. <hi>The way, and life, and truth;</hi> and makes them to be ſound in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The truth of judgement and underſtanding: Joh. 17. 17. <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Truth of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                        <hi>them with thy truth;</hi> by which ſome think is meant the true underſtanding of all things neceſſary to ſalvation: This is called <hi>the Spirit of a ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. a mind not tainted, not corrupted: <hi>Sound in the Faith,</hi> Titus 1. 13. and Chap. 2. 2.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, to worſhip God in ſpirit, is</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To have our inward man taken up, imployed, and acting in all thoſe Religious duties which we do owe, and which we do preſent unto him. As when <note place="margin">What it is to worſhip God in Spirit.</note> we draw near to him in prayer, for power to repent, to believe, to obey, &amp;c. not only our mouthes do pray, but our very hearts alſo do pray, and our prayers are the lifting up of our hearts: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 25. 1. <hi>(Let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens,</hi> Lam. 3. 41.) And <hi>the very deſires of our ſouls,</hi> Iſa. 26. 8. <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name.</hi> And when you come to him in confeſſion of ſins, not only your lips do acknowledge them, and condemn you for them, but your very hearts are aſhamed of them, and bewail them, and judge them: And ſo when you come to hear the Word, a bodily preſence doth not ſatisfie you, but your hearts do come with your bodies, and your hearts do hear, and your hearts are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word with gladneſs and fear.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To have an edge upon our hearts in the ſervices of God, a kind of heavenly vigor and ſtrenuouſneſſe, ſo that our ſouls do come in to it with all the actual ſtrength which they have for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>Indeed a Chriſtan hath ſometimes a ſtronger and quicker keeneſs of ſpirit than he hath at other times, but ſtill he puts forth (as leaſt in his deſires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours) what power he hath in his communion with God: As he ſeeks God with his mouth, ſo he ſeeks him with his whole heart: Pſal. 119. 10. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee;</hi> he doth not ſerve the Lord with a cold, formal, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpirit, but as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Rom. 12. 11. <hi>He is fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord:</hi> He prayes and hears fervently, and repents fervently, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves fervently: 'Tis true that he falls very ſhort; yet what he doth to the Lord, he doth the ſame in good earneſt, it is his work, and his buſineſs; and if he finds

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f, if he finds a dulneſs and deadneſs upon his ſpirit, this troubles him, and he ſtrives to ſhake it off, by ſtirring up himſelf (as the phraſe is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. and that of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.) and by awaking of his heart and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>(I my ſelf will awake,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 108. 2.) and beſeeching of the Lord to quicken and to enlarge his heart: <hi>I will run the way of thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart,</hi> Pſal. 119. 32.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, They who have the Spirit of God, are moſt pleaſed and delighted in <note place="margin">Such delight in ſpiritual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations.</note> ſpiritual and vigorous miniſtrations, which deal moſt with their ſpirits, and do in a ſpiritual power moſt reach their hearts and ſpiritual condition. Beloved, this you ſhall find in experience, that a profane heart cannot endure but alwayes hates and deſpiſeth a ſpiritual and ſearching Miniſtry. A formal heart hath moſt ſatisfaction in a formal Miniſtry. A gracious heart is alwayes beſt pleaſed with a ſpiritual and powerful Miniſtry, with that Miniſtry which doth come <hi>in power, and in the demonſtration of the Spirit,</hi> and makes it ſelf mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto the conſciences of men, which is <hi>quick in operation and piercing even to the dividing aſunder of the ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. and which <hi>is mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 1. <hi>Caſting down imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and every high thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> ver. 5. This ſpiritual Miniſtry is that with which a ſpiritual heart doth and can moſt cloſe. O a Miniſtry which doth moſt dive into the heart, and diſcovers the depth of ſin, and the hidden things of the heart, and the ſecret guiles and hypocriſies of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits! And that Miniſtry which ſhames our ſins moſt, and rents them out of our boſomes, and makes our ſouls to loath them! And that Miniſtry which like a ſpiritual Adamant draws a heart to Chriſt, breaking down all the powers of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief! And that Miniſtry which diſcovers and daſhes in pieces all our ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and all our ſelf-confideace! And that Miniſtry which preſſeth and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one to the power of godlineſs, and to the practical expreſſing of the virtues of Jeſus Chriſt, and of him that calleth us! And that Miniſtry which raiſeth a drooping ſoul with ſpiritual truth, and rules, though never ſo ſtrict and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood! This is a Spiritual Miniſtry, and this is a Miniſtry of the Spirit, and this is the Miniſtry which every one (who indeed hath the Spirit of God) doth highly prize, doth cordially cloſe with, and deſires from his ſoul to live under: Pſal. 139. 23. <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts.</hi> Ver. 24. <hi>And ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi>

                     <p>Seventhly, They who have the Spirit, have this property alſo that they are ſingularly tender as to that ſpirit; which appears in four things.</p>

                        <item>1. In no caſe will they part with the Spirit: Pſal. 6. 11. <hi>Take not thy holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from me!</hi>

                     <p>2. Uſe I Now proceed unto a ſecond Uſe, which ſhall be of Comfort unto all and every one unto whom the Spirit of God is given, who do find him in their hearts in any of thoſe works and ſaving effects before-mentioned; Not without cauſe doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> take pleaſure in this, <hi>I have the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>we have received the Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is given unto us:</hi> Yea Chriſt himſelf look't upon the ſending and giving of the Spirit to be the Comforter unto his Diſciples, as equivalent unto his own preſence with them, and as a ſufficient cordial againſt all the troubles of their heart, and againſt all the temptations of the world.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. But will ſome ſay, <hi>What benefit and happineſs is there by having the Spirit of God given unto us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I will anſwer you 1. In the general. 2ly In particular unto this Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>1. In the General.</p>
                     <p>The preſence of the Spirit of God within you, it is an infallible evidence of <note place="margin">The benefits which come by having the ſpirit. Such are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their election.</note> your happineſs in the whole eſtate of it from firſt to laſt, from eternity to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the time paſt to the time preſent, and the time to come.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For the time paſt: Beloved, our happineſs begins long before we do begin; it begins in the eternal love of God, and in the election of God, <hi>before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. The Records of election are Records of Eternity; that is the date of writing our names in heaven, and in the book of life: And queſtionleſs this is a great part of our bleſſedneſs (it is the firſt ſtone thereof which is ſaid) that we are (out of a free and an immutable love and purpoſe) ſet down and infallibly choſen and ordained for bleſſedneſs; of which gracious act the preſence of the Spirit is a ſure evidence unto us: 2 Theſ. 2. 13. <hi>God hath from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning choſen you to ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>He hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, For the time preſent; it is (you know) a common doubt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among ſerious and ſolid Chriſtians, whether their preſent ſpiritual condition <note place="margin">Such have the ſpirits preſence to aſſure them that God is their Father.</note> be right and ſound? whether or no they have a real relation to God as their Father? and whether Chriſt be in them of a truth? and verily that eſtate is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and ſound, and ſure in which there is ſuch a relation and ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Now when the Spirit of God is given, his preſence and work are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted evidences of him: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>We have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our spirit that we are the children of God.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For the time to come; there is reſerved for all the people of God in heaven, an <hi>incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. <note place="margin">Aſſured of their ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>A Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10. <hi>An exceedingly exceeding, and eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17. And of this alſo is the preſence of the Spirit a ſure evidence unto us: Epheſ. 1. 13, 14. <hi>The holy Spirit is the earneſt of our inheritance; q. d.</hi> The Lord will hereafter give you full poſſeſſion, he hath promiſed you no leſs than an heavenly kingdom, and a glorious inheritance; for you are his Children and Heirs; and to ſatisfie and aſſure you of this, he hath given you a pledge or earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and that earneſt is his own Spirit; in that you have for the preſent the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, this is your earneſt that you ſhall hereafter fully enjoy the kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p>And now I beſeech you tell me, whether the enjoying of the Spirit of God be not very happy and comfortable?</p>
                     <p>

If you look back, by this you know that your names are written in heaven: If you look on your preſent condition, by this you know that God is your Father, and you are his children; Chriſt is yours, and you are Chriſts: If you look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by this alſo you know that heavenly glory is yours, and ſhortly you ſhall perfectl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But let us deſcend unto particulars, which if we do rightly underſtand and conſider of, we muſt confeſs that to have the Spirit given unto us, it is an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſing and mercy.</p>
                     <p>You read in Scripture of ſeveral Attributes (if I may ſo call them) given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit, and all of them in relation unto thoſe to whom he is given; And every one of them reſpecting their good and benefit all the dayes of their life; He is called</p>

                        <item>1. A holy and ſanctifying Spirit. <note place="margin">What the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is called in Scripture.</note>

                     </list>
                     <p>1 Fifthly, The Spirit of God which is given unto you is a holy and ſanctifying <note place="margin">He is a holy and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit.</note> Spirit: He is the <hi>holy Spirit of God;</hi> Epheſ. 4. 30. And the <hi>Spirit ſanctifies,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.</p>
                     <p>Now there are three comforts from this, that the Spirit of God (within you) is a ſanctifying Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He ſanctifies you in truth, he renews your very hearts; it is not a formal or <note place="margin">Sanctifies in truth.</note> deceivable work, but a real and effectual work, which is indeen the new Creation, 2 Cor. 5. 17, 18. the image of God, the life and glory of Chriſt which ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly end in happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He will go on with his ſanctifying work, he will begin and make an end: <note place="margin">Cauſeth growth in grace.</note> 1 Theſ. 5. 23. He will change you from <hi>glory to glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Though it begins in weakneſs, he will carry it on in power: This ſanctifying work of the Spirit ſhall move on in the ſoul as the ſun doth in the firmament, from ſtrength to ſtrength; the Spirit within will more and more mortifie, and weaken, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the body of ſin, and he will be <hi>renewing your inward man day by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He will ſtill maintain and preſerve this ſanctifying work againſt all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions <note place="margin">Defends it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all its enemies.</note> of our corruptions, and againſt all the aſſaults of Satan, and will never leave untill he hath crowned it with glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Spirit of God which is given unto you, is a revealing and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting Spirit: He is expreſly called <hi>the Spirit of revelation,</hi> in Epheſ. 1. 17. and <note place="margin">He is a reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit.</note> verily herein doth lie moſt admirable comfort and joy; yea all our actual ſoul joy in this life: If all the thoughts and works of grace were hid from us, we ſhould have but ſad dayes all our life long, we ſhould be in perpetual fears and doubts, and complaints: But the diſcovery of them (which is by the light of the Spirit) makes day with us, makes joy and rejoycing abound within us.</p>
                     <p>Now there are four things which the Spirit of God (given unto the people of God) can and doth reveal unto them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The preſence of Chriſt within us: Though Chriſt be in us (for he <hi>dwells</hi>

                        <hi>in our hearts by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 17) yet we cannot ſee or diſcover his preſence but by the Spirit: <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi>

                        </gap> Joh. 3. 24. To know that Chriſt is mine, and in me, and that I am Chriſts, and in him, cannot be without the Spirit, and this manifeſtation is from the Spirit; and is not this joy and comfort indeed to know that

Chriſt is in us? <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The love of God towards us: 'Tis true that God doth love his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a moſt gracious love, and with a great love, and with a moſt kind love; <note place="margin">Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if we could know his love unto us, this would pacifie us; and how ſhould we come to taſt how gracious the Lord is? by the holy Ghoſt; Rom. 5. 5. <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, The wonderful glory prepared for us; Mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">The glory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us.</note> 1 Cor. 2. 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love.</hi> Ver. 10 <hi>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit, for the Spirt ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God;</hi> the quality and quantity of future happineſs prepared from eternity, and muſt anſwer the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All the precious works of the Spirit, himſelf with his finger hath <note place="margin">The precious works of the ſpirit.</note> wrought in us: Though there be an aptitude in them to manifeſt and diſcover themſelves, yet we cannot ſee them without the Spirit: How often are we in darkneſs? how often in doubts and enquiries, but have I faith? but have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? but have I godly ſorrow? but have I the new heart? the tender heart? the humble heart? In truth! <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Firſt, One may have the real preſence of the Spirit, and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">The ſpirit may be really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and yet not diſcovered, Its in deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> have no ſenſible diſcoveries of his preſence, as to his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: As</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the time of deſertions when the Lord hides himſelf from the ſoul, and draws off, and leaves it a while to ſit in darkneſs and in ſilence; in ſuch a caſe though there be actings of the Spirit, and puttings forth tears and groans, and complaints <hi>(Will the Lord caſt off for ever? will he be favourable no more?</hi> Pſal. 77. 7.) yet the deſerted ſoul diſcerns them not in a Relative way, as working teſtimonies of the preſence of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In time of great tranſgreſſions: Then the Spirit as is it were in a ſwoon, and the light appears not, and confuſion and darkneſs riſe upon our graces; <hi>David</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</note>
                        <pb n="620" facs="tcp:55323:326"/>
in his great tranſgreſſions looks upon all as loſt, and therefore prayes that <hi>the Lord would not take his holy Spirit from him,</hi> Pſal. 51. 11.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, One may have the Spirit of God within him, and yet ſometimes (as to his own thinking) the diſcoveries may be rather that he hath not the ſpirit, than that he hath; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of God, <hi>he holds me for his enemy,</hi> Job. 13. 24. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>caſt me not off,</hi> Pſal. 43. 2. And the Church ſaith, <hi>my God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me,</hi> Iſa. 49. 14.</p>
                     <p>This is our condition in the times of vile temptation, and in the time of ſad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and there is no grace in me, no faith, no love, ſoftneſs of heart, no ability to pray,; all was but hypocriſie, there was never any thing in truth wrought within my ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There are comforting diſcoveries of the preſence of the Spirit; and <note place="margin">Other effects of the Spirit.</note> there are proper and reſpective diſcoveries of this preſence as to our preſent ways, and works, and needs: Perhaps you have not the manifeſtations of the ſpirit in the effect of peace, and joy, and aſſurance, and yet you may have the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit in the effects of mourning for ſin, and conflicting with it, and prayer againſt it, and to walk uprightly: Perhaps you find not the preſence of the Spirit diſcovering himſelf in ſtrong and powerful actings in your ſouls, and yet you may find the Spirit diſcovering himſelf in making you to hunger after Chriſt: Perhaps you find not the Spirits preſence in raiſing your hearts with his teſtimony, and yet you find his preſence in humbling your hearts for the ſins into which you are fallen.

                     <p>Fourthly, By the mixture of contrary workings; a little of grace, and much of corruption; a little of faith, and much of doubtings; a little of hope, and <note place="margin">By the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary workings</note> much of fear; a little of ſorrow, and much of hardneſs; a little of prayer, and much of diſtraction; a little of zeal, and much of flatneſs; a little that is done, and much that is undone; a little of knowledge, and much of ignorance; a little heavenly-mindedneſs, and much of earthlineſs; a little fire, and much ſmoak; a little going, and much halting, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, By the aptneſs to live not by faith, but by ſenſe; when God draws up all our helps and hopes into his promiſes, and puts us now to fetch all our ſupplies <note place="margin">By aptneſs to live by ſence.</note> and comforts from his good and faithful Word, Here is my Word that I will pardon your ſins; and here is my Word that I will ſubdue your iniquities; and here is my Word that I will anſwer your prayers; and here is my Word that I will ſupply your wants; and I will <hi>never leave you nor forſake you;</hi> O but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we feel not the aſſurance of pardon, and becauſe we find not victory over our ſins, and becauſe we do not ſee the anſwet of our prayers, and becauſe we cannot diſcern the means and wayes how our wants may be ſupplyed, therefore our hearts fail us, and we are troubled and perplexed, and ſad thoughts do ariſe in our hearts, and they are much caſt down within us; If it be thus with us, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our graces are weak, very weak; the leſſe able are ye to truſt an All ſufficient and faithful God in his promiſes, but you muſt have the portion in your own hands, you muſt ſee or elſe you will not believe, you cannot ſo ſtedfaſtly believe that Gods Bond is ſufficient, &amp;c. <label type="milestone">

                     <p n="6">6. Fire doth revive, and as it were put a new life into us, when we are frozen or benummed: So doth the Spirit quicken and enlarge our hearts when they are oppreſſed with dulneſs and deadneſs.</p>
                     <p>In theſe and ſome other reſpects is the Spirit of God (with his graces) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fire; which may be quenched either in part, as when you ſuffer it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ſlack, or in whole when it goes out all together.</p>
                     <p>There are four wayes by which the fire is quenched.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By withdrawing and with-holding the fuell which ſhould nouriſh it: <note place="margin">How this fire is quenched.</note> So when we withdraw our ears from hearing the Word, and reſtrain Prayer, and decline holy ſociety and conference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we do now quench the Spirit in his gifts and graces, they will decay, and fall, and dye with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By caſting on water; though you put much wood to the fire, yet if you caſt more water upon it, this will quench the fire: So although you ſhould hear, and pray, yet if you admit groſs ſins, theſe will quench the Spirit; they will either totally extinguiſh, or elſe extreamly dimin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſh the graces of the Spirit. <hi>David</hi> found it ſo by his groſs ſins of adultery, and murder: And <hi>Sampſon</hi> found it ſo in his looſneſs with <hi>Dalilah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By ſmothering of it: Though you do not withdraw fuell from the fire, nor throw water upon it, yet if you heap upon it much cold earth, or green wood, this will ſmother and put out the fire: though you do not decline Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and duties, you do not fall into groſs ſins, yet if you ſuffer your heart to be overcloy'd with the things of the world, with the cares and employments of it, theſe will choak the word, and theſe will ſmother and quench the operations of the Spirit within you.</p>
                     <p>Fourth By neglecting of it: If we do not look unto the fire, and put the Brands together, and ſtir and blow it up, it will decay and go out: So if we neglect the graces of the Spirit, if we do not ſtir them up as <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 6. ſhake off the contrary indiſpoſition, and put them out in daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, they will decay, and will be ready to dye.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But ſome will ſay,</hi> Quorſum haec? <hi>may a Christian loſe the Spirit? fall away from grace? can the work of the Spirit be wholly extinguiſhed? where is then the comfort and the happineſs you lately ſpake of?</hi>

                     <p>And there are two things of the Spirit which we ſhould not neglect. 1. His movings. 2ly. His removings.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Neglect not the removings of the Spirit: The Spirit of God (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our ſpiritual pride, and ſecurity, and formality, and other ſins) may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from us <hi>(i. e.)</hi> you may not find that comfort from him, and you may not find that ſtrength, and aſſiſtance, and vigor from him, and you may diſcern a general Hatneſs and lowneſs in your graces and ſervices, they come not off with that zeal, with that delight, with that care, with that love, with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, with that fervency, with that faith as formerly; and you are more ready to fall under temptations, and ſinful occaſions; you cannot make that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which you were wont to do! The Spirit in theſe caſes is removing and withdrawing: And it is a moſt dangerous folly now to ſit ſtill and to be careleſs and regardleſs. If a Guard which preſerves you, draw off, are you not in danger? are you not expoſed to enemies? why? all your ſtrength, ſupport, ſufficiency, ſafety is in the preſence of Gods Spirit. Therefore take notice of his removings or or withdrawings at any time, and do it quickly, and ſeriouſly; for though his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves be not (uſually) all at once, yet the oftner he removes, he removes the farther from you; and the farther he removes the ſtronger will hardneſs grow upon you.</p>

                     <p>If the Word of God be given for theſe ends, For <hi>Doctrine</hi> to teach us the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith; for <hi>Reproof</hi> to convince errors; for <hi>Correction</hi> to condemn ſin; for <hi>Inſtruction</hi> to ſhew us our duties, and to make us perfect: To beget us: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the Word of truth:</hi> To build us up: <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 33. <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified:</hi> then certainly the preſence of the Spirit; and the Miniſtry of the Word are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, nor are they to be dijoyned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the Lord Jeſus himſelf hath inſtituted ſome men particularly for his ſervice, and the benefit of his Church, and hath committed the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Evangelical Ordinances unto them; then no man under pretence that he hath the Spirit, may ſlight and neglect the Ordinances; but Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſome perſons in the Church for Miniſterial ſervice, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and teachers.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> What need of theſe if the preſence of the Spirit without theſe be ſufficient? 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt, Apoſtles; ſecundarily, Prophets; thirdly, Teachers.</hi> Ver. 29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi> To theſe and not to all, hath he committed the diſpenſation of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Ordinances: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let a man ſo account of us as the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God.</hi> Matth. 28. 19. <hi>Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, &amp;c. and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What, are all theſe Ordinances inſtruted, and fixed, and that by the will of Chriſt, and yet uſeleſs for men that have the Spirit of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, What mean thoſe ſeveral paſſages in the Scriptures? Jam. 1. 19. <hi>Be ſwift to hear.</hi> 1 Per. 2 2. <hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>Deſpiſe not Prepheſying.</hi> Luke 10. 16. <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, despiſeth me, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 59. 21. <hi>This is my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord, my Spirit that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and my Spirit which I have put within thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord hence forth for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If the Spirit be given unto us to make the Ordinances effectual unto us, then his preſence ſhould not take us off from Ordinances, but the Spirit is given to make the Ordinances effectual, they are ſo

                     <p>Secondly, Having ſpoken theſe things, I ſhall now look upon thoſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Scriptures, and ſee whether they conclude the needleſneſs of Ordinances after the reception of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>They ſhall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, &amp;c. Hence the Anabaptiſts do conclude that there is no need of Teachers nor</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, I would fain know Whether theſe people have among them a Church of Chriſt, yea or no? if they have, then I would know Whether they have any <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures opened.</note> Teachers of the Word, and Labourers in the Word and Doctrine, any teaching publickly in their Churches?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But to the place of the Prophet, who ſets out the difference between the Old Teſtament and the New. 1. In reſpect of efficacy, this he layes down in <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after theſe dayes ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> 2ly, In reſpect of Clarity, that in the times of the new Covenant there ſhould be a more clear and plentiful effuſion of knowledge than in the old Covenant; for when Chriſt came, then did <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe,</hi> the light of which was ſevenſold to what the light was before his coming: they before his coming had but a dark knowledge, thoſe after his coming had a more clear and full knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>True, and they had ſo much knowledge, that they needed not to be taught, they ſhall no more teach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> That expreſſion is not to be taken litterally and abſolutely, as if thoſe that live under the Goſpel ſhould need no teaching at all; for we read an expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (relating unto Goſpel-times) to the contrary: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Many people ſhall go and ſay, Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion ſhall go out the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> But the words are to be taken Reſtrictively and Comparatively; therefore if you obſerve them, it is not ſaid only <hi>they ſhall no more teach every one his neighbour;</hi> but they ſhall no more teach every man his neighbour, <hi>ſaying, know the Lord:</hi> So that God doth promiſe under the Goſpel ſuch a meaſure of knowledge, as that his people now ſhall not be <hi>Alphabetarii</hi> any more; need to be taught the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Faith any more; theſe they ſhould all of them clearly know, and much more clearly than many or moſt living under the old Covenant or Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Object. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27. <hi>You need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The Apoſtle having in the former words delivered many excellent and comfortable truths, he concludes with a perſwaſion of their knowledge of, and aſſent unto them, <hi>q. d.</hi> you are the people of God, you have received his Spirit, you know theſe things to be true; I write them unto you not as to the ignorant but knowing Chriſtian; you know them aſſuredly, the Spirit given unto you hath enabled you to know, and to acknowledge them, ſo that no man needs to teach you them, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, laſtly, the Spirit is injured when any do Father upon him their odd Opinions, and wild fancies, and deluſions, and ſometimes their abominable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies which are not to be named amongſt Chriſtians, but with deteſtation: The Spirit of God is the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of holineſs; and to entitle him unto any errors or wickedneſs, it is no leſs then to blaſpheme and reproach him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The fifth Caution which I would commend to you that have the <note place="margin">Envy not the gifts of the Spirit in others</note> Spirit, is this; Do not envy the gifts and graces of the Spirit in any man, nor ſpeak evil of them: Numb. 11. 29. <hi>And Moſes ſaid unto Joſhua, Envieſt thou for my ſake? Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them.</hi> The Spirit of God gives different gifts unto men to profit withall: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſdom, to another the word of knowledge by the ſame Spirit,</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>To ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith by the ſame Spirit,</hi> Ver. 9. And there are different meaſures of his gifts; ſome do excell in one gift, and ſome in another; and this holds true in publick perſons, and in private perſons; &amp; all of us ſhould rejoyce in all theſe manifeſtations of the Spirit: It ſhould not grieve us that any one is good, nor that he can do good in his private way, or in his publick way; nor ſhould it grieve and trouble us if any man hath more grace, or that he can do more good, bring more glory to Chriſt than we do or can. The end of every Chriſtian is Gods glory; now every one ſhould mind that, and contribute towards that; one man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more, and every man ſhould contribute his utmoſt towards it; is it not enough if Chriſt be magnified, and thy ſoul ſaved?</p>

                     <p>2.

                        <pb n="635" facs="tcp:55323:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Spirit of gladneſs as well as of mourning; <hi>Say unto my ſoul, I am thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Be of good comfort, go in peace, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Thy heart is ready to ſink and break for want of comfort, why!

                     <p>Secondly, For the works which he hath begun, but hath not as yet perfected and finiſhed within you; as all the works of grace, of knowledge, of faith, of love, &amp;c. be not content with a little of theſe, but (as the Apoſtle exhorts in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18.) <hi>Be filled with the Spirit;</hi> labour to encreaſe and abound in all fruits of the Spirit: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 13. <hi>Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the houſe of our God.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I will briefly anſwer two Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>1. Queſt. One is, <hi>Why they that have the Spirit of grace, ſhould ſtrive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why ſuch as have grace ſhould labour to grow in it.</note> 
                        <hi>and to abound in grace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol</hi> There are five Reaſons for it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This will teſtifie the truth that is in them: That they have the graces of the Spirit: indeed there are three things (amongſt many others) which do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie grace in truth. 1. One is Power. 2. The ſecond is Growth. 3. The third is Perſeverance.</p>
                     <p>Dead things, and Artificial things have no growth, <hi>q.</hi> becauſe they have no life: <hi>Every branch in me that beareth fruit, the Father purgeth that it may bring forth more fruit,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Yea and this teſtifies that <hi>the Spirit is in you of a truth;</hi> for the Spirit changeth us <hi>from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. When the Spirit changeth us at the firſt from ſinfulneſs to holineſs, this is a glorious change (for as the natural eſtate is vile and inglorious, ſo the renewed and ſanctified eſtate is an excellent and glorious eſtate) and when the Spirit begins a glorious change, he proceeds and makes it ſtill more glorious; the ſpirit changeth us <hi>from glory to glory:</hi> Grace makes us glorious, and more grace makes us more glorious; the more grace, the more glory; and where the Spirit of God is, there he carries on his work from glory to glory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The more that ye do grow in the graces of the ſpirit, the greater and fuller is your conformity unto Chriſt! Grace is in Chriſt as in a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and perfection, as in a pattern: Now the more you have in anſwerableneſs to the pattern, the fuller is your conformity; a little grace in us reſembles that grace which is in Chriſt; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> But as thoſe who lived under the Old Teſtament, had ſome glimpſes of Chriſt, but they that lived under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had a more clear knowledge of him, face to face: So they that have but a little of grace, there is ſome reſemblance and manifeſtation in them of the image of Chriſt; but they who are high in grace, they are nearer to Chriſt in the reſemblance of his excellent perfection of holineſs, and to ſpeak plainly, there is much more of Chriſt in them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The more you obtain in the proportion of grace, the greater Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of honour will you be able to bring in to God: I told you that the weakeſt grace can enable you to bring God ſome honour; why then much grace can help you farther in that ſervice, it can ſet up his Name on high: A little Faith can honour God, but a ſtrong Faith (ſuch as <hi>Abrahams</hi> or <hi>Moſes's)</hi> will bring more honour to his goodneſs and faithfulneſs; a little love will make you to do ſomething for Chriſt, but much love will make you do much more: The more grace that you attain, the more gloriouſly will you ſhine in your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in all the fruits of Righteouſneſs, with more fulneſs, evenneſs, and ſtedfaſtneſs, and all this glorifies your Father which is in heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="636" facs="tcp:55323:334" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fifthly, You your ſelves would gain more, if your graces were increaſed more. <hi>e. g.</hi> You would certainly find more peace in conſcience, and more freedom from ſlaviſh fears, and doubts, and more confidence in your acceſſes to God, and more ſweetneſs in the Ordinances of Chriſt, and more enlargement of heart in all your communions with God, and more wiſdom and ſtrength againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>How may one know that he hath much of the Spirit of God in him? that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How to know that we have much of Gods ſpirit in us. If more humble.</note> 
                        <hi>grace is increaſed and raiſed, that he is more ſpiritual?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> You may know it thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If you be more humble: The more pride, alwayes either no grace, or very little; but the more humility, ſtill the more grace; mark the Records in Scripture, and you ſhall find the moſt excellent in grace have been the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in humility, <hi>e. g. Abraham, Jacob, Moſes, David, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> For much grace, 1. Diſcovers moſt wants. 2ly Moſt failings. 3ly Moſt ſelf-inſufficiency. 4ly Moſt ſelf-unworthineſs. 5ly That all our receptions are from meer grace and mercy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If you be more exact in your walking, giving no juſt occaſion either <note place="margin">If more exact in our walking.</note> of offence to the weak, or of grief to the ſtrong Chriſtians, or of reproach to them that are without. A man that can order his converſation, ſo as good men are edified by him, and wicked men have their mouthes ſtopped, or cannot ſpeak ill of him without lying, he hath a great meaſure of grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If a man be able <hi>to drink of the cup which Christ did drink, and to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">If able to ſuffer afflictions.</note> 
                        <hi>be baptized with the baptiſme wherewith Chriſt was baptized</hi> (Mat. 20. 22, 23.) this man hath got on far in the work of grace: The more able that you are to ſuffer reproaches, and loſſes, yea death itſelf for Chriſt, the greater is your faith, and the ſtronger is your love; when you can <hi>rejoyce in tribulations,</hi> bear the reproaches for Chriſt, taking the Croſs as your Crown, and triumph that ye are counted worthy to ſuffer for his Name.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If you be able to govern your tongues with wiſdome, and meekneſs, <note place="margin">If we can wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern our tongues.</note> and grace, and truth, this is a ſign that you are ſtrong in grace: <hi>Jam.</hi> 3, 2. <hi>If any offend not in word; the ſame is a perfect man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The leſs careful we are for outward things, and the more able we are to truſt God, and to look on his Promiſes, with as much chearfulneſs as others do <note place="margin">If able to truſt God without carking cares.</note> only in their performances: If we can bleſs and praiſe God when he takes away, as well as when he gives: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. 10. <hi>In God will I praiſe his word, in the Lord will I praiſe his word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The more complyance with, and contentedneſs in all the changes which do befall us in our journey to heaven in theſe dayes of our pilgrimage, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <note place="margin">If contented in all changes.</note> this declares a preſence of much grace: The Lord ſaith of <hi>Job</hi> that there <hi>was not a man like him in all the earth, he was eminently good and upright;</hi> and he it was who bleſſed God in his great changes: Job 1. 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Chap. 2. 10. <hi>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> See <hi>Paul</hi> that ſtrong Chriſtian, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 11. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever eſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>I know how to be abuſed, and I know how to abound; everywhere, and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to ſuffer need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A fourth duty which concerns you who have received the Spirit, is <note place="margin">Our hearts muſt be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things.</note> this; your hearts ſhould be more earneſtly and fixedly, and entirely carried unto, and laid out for ſpiritual things; ſpiritual objects, and treaſures ſhould be of more value with you, and they ſhould draw out your thoughts and affections to the utmoſt: other things ſhould be of ſmall account with you: If the Spirit be in you, then the things of the ſpirit ſhould be in you: as wickedneſs is in the wicked man, and the world is in the worldly man, ſo ſhould ſpiritual things be in a

                     <p>Firſt, The Spirit and Chriſt come alwayes together: If any man hath Chriſt, <note place="margin">The Spirit and Chriſt come alwayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> he hath the Spirit; if any man hath the Spirit, he hath Chriſt; if any man hath not the Spirit, he hath not Chriſt; Chriſt and the Spirit ever go together: Should not this provoke us to ſtrive with God for his Spirit; what ſinner on earth would not have Chriſt? what will become of us without Chriſt? how happy is every ſoul in the enjoyment of him? how miſerable in the want of him? how longing are the hearts of ſome for Chriſt, and for the knowledge that Chriſt is their Chriſt? But if the Spirit of God be yours, then the Sonne of God is yours: Here is a double portion at once, a double gift at once, the Spirit of God and Jeſus Chriſt at once: If you mind not the Spirit for the Spirits ſake, yet mind the Spirit for Chriſts ſake; your deſires after him, muſt come from the ſpirit, and your union with him muſt come from the ſpirit, and your knowledge of the perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

but if the Spirit be given unto him, then aſſuredly Chriſt is given unto him; <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Forgiveneſs of ſins and the Spirit alway are given together: Though <note place="margin">The Spirit and pardon of ſin go together.</note> forgiveneſs of ſin be one thing, and the Spirit in us another thing, yet they are both given together: A man hath not his ſins pardoned, and yet he remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied without the Spirit; and a man is not ſanctified by the Spirit, and yet his ſins remain unpardoned, but both are given together at the ſame time: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>This is he that came by water and blood, even Jeſus Chriſt, not by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only, but by water and blood, and it is the Spirit that beareth witneſs.</hi> 1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that the blood of Chriſt is the only meritorious cauſe of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins; God forgives our ſins for Chriſts ſake; but then it is as true, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of forgiveneſs and reconciliation of the Spirit are given together: Hath God ſanctified thy heart by his Spirit? aſſuredly he hath forgiven thy ſins. Hath God indeed ſhewed thee mercy in forgiving thy ſins, he hath then aſſuredly given unto thee the Spirit of grace to change thy ſinful heart!</p>
                     <p>Now would you have your ſins forgiven? do you look on forgiveneſs as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable mercy? as a mercy of life, and of peace, and of hope; O then get the Spirit of God; God never forgives a man his ſins, but he gives his Spirit: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins is the great deed of mercy written in the blood of Chriſt, and the giving of the Spirit is the ſeal of that deed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Spirit and excellency alwayes go together: <hi>Can we finde ſuch a one as this is? a man in whom the Spirit of God is;</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharaoh</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 41. 38.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A work or duty laid out for all the people in Covenant with God. [They are to <hi>walk in his ſtatutes, and to keep his judgements, and to do them.]</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The work or duty which belongs to the people of God, is ſet forth in divers <hi>Metaphorical</hi> expreſſions, as <hi>walking in Gods ſtatutes;</hi> which notes the path of their ſteps, and the Rule of their converſation and work, likewiſe the progreſſive courſe of their obedience, and <hi>keeping of his judgements;</hi> By the judgements of God are meant his commands; and by the keeping of them, two things are implyed: 1. To make them dear unto us, to lay them up as our treaſure, as a precious part of the will of God: And then 2ly To conform our ſelves unto them, to ſubmit unto them as to our Rule, to live up unto them; <hi>Servare, &amp; obſervare,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And doing of them;</hi> This expeſſion I conceive to be the explication of the two former, and it notes real and practical obedience unto Gods ſtatutes and judgements.</p>
                     <p>From all this, there are two Propoſitions, unto which I deſire briefly to ſpeak unto. <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <pb n="644" facs="tcp:55323:339" rendition="simple:additions"/>
2. The other is, that they keep Covenant: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 18. <hi>To ſuch as keep</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">They keep Covenant with God.</note> 
                     <hi>his Covenant;</hi> and this he expounds in the following words, <hi>to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Commandements to do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we enter into Covenant with God, what is it that we do? I ſuppoſe (if we do underſtand our ſelves) that we do then take him to be our God; 1. In his Gracious Mercy. 2ly In his Righteous Society; that he, and he alone ſhall be our Lord, our King to Rule and guide, and preſcribe us laws, and we will be his people to hearken unto him, to be at his command, to obey his voice and will. Is any man ſo wild to make ſuch a Covenant with God, or to think that God will make ſuch a Covenant as this with him? I will have mercy and bleſſing from God, but I will not obey him; he ſhall be none of my Lord nor King. or that God will yield to theſe termes, I will be yours for all bleſſings, but live as you liſt, do what you pleaſe, walk how you will, ſerve your luſts, regard not my Law? Did God ever make ſuch a Covenant as this! Saith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15. 1. <hi>I am tby ſhield and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> And Chap. 17. 1. <hi>I am the Almighty God,</hi> I am able to do thee good, and will do ſo; but then he addes, <hi>walk before mee and be thou perfect,</hi> q. d. I will be a God to you for bleſſing, and alſo a God over you for Ruling; I expect that you ſhould walk uprightly before me <hi>(i. e.)</hi> obſerve my wayes, my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and act them with ſincerity of heart, not willingly diſobey and prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: <hi>So Exod.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>If ye will obey my voice in doing and keeping my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me above all people.</hi> And (Verſe 6.) <hi>Ye ſhall be unto me a Kingdom of Priests, and an holy Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a little more to demonſtrate this truth unto you, be pleaſed to conſider theſe five particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe ſeveral Relations which fall upon all people who come to be in <note place="margin">The relations betwixt God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant require obedience.</note> Covenant with God, and they are all ſuch as lay obligations upon them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to walking in his Statutes: They are the children of God, and have God to be their Father: Now ſaith God to them that pretend to ſtand in this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but walk diſobediently, <hi>A ſon honoureth his Father,</hi> Mal. 1. 6. <hi>And if I be a father, where is mine honour?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are the ſervants of God, and God is their Lord and Maſter: Now ſaith he in the ſame place, <hi>a ſervant honoureth his Maſter;</hi> And <hi>if I be a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> ſhould not a Lord and Maſter be feared? and what is it to fear God, but to have an awful reſpect to his Commandements, and a tender care to do his will? They are his ſubjects, and he is their King; he is the Lord that Reigneth over them, gives Laws unto them; and are not his Subjects <hi>a willing people in the day of his power?</hi> Do not his Saints humble themſelves, <hi>ſit down at his feet, and receive of his words?</hi> doth not the <hi>fiery Law</hi> proceed from his right hand for them whom he calls his Saints? <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2, 3.</p>

Having ſpoken theſe things for the demonſtration of the Aſſertion, I ſhall now ſpeak unto three Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How this walking in Gods ſtatutes, and keeping of his judgements, and doing of them, may be fixed upon the people of Gods Covenant, ſeeing they are all of them believers, and being ſo are no longer under the Law, but are freed and delivered from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What manner of obedience, or kind of obedience that is which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:55323:340" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to be performed by the people of Gods Covenant?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why theſe are in ſuch a ſpecial manner thus charged with walking in Gods ſtatutes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. Queſt. <hi>How this walking in Gods ſtatutes, &amp;c. may be forced upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gods Covenant, ſeeing they are all under grace, and believers, and not under</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How Gods people being not under the Law, are bound to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> 
                     <hi>the Law, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> For a clear Anſwer unto this Queſtion, I will briefly deliver my thoughts in theſe diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Concerning the Law of God, you know there were ſome of them</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ceremonial, which conſiſted in Rites, and Ordinances, and Shadows, typifying Jeſus Chriſt in his ſufferings, unto which there was a full period put by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Judicial, which reſpecteth the <hi>Jews</hi> as a peculiar Nation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, being made and fitted for them, as in ſuch a particular polity: And all thoſe Judicial Laws (eſpecially theſe <hi>de jure particulari)</hi> are ceaſed by the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of that Nation and polity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moral; which are theſe ſet down in the Decalogue, and are called the ten words (or Commandements) which God ſpake and delivered. Of the ten Commandements (which we call the Moral Law) is the queſtion to be underſtood, whether believers, or the people in the New Covenant are bound unto them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Moral Law may be conſidered either 1. In the Subſtance of it; Or 2ly in the circumſtances of it.</p>
                  <p>If you conſider the Moral Law in the ſubſtance of it; ſo it is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An eternal manifeſtation of the mind and will of God, declaring what is good, and what is evil; what we are to do, and what we are not to do; what duties we <note place="margin">How the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law never ceaſeth.</note> do owe to God, and what duties we do owe to our neighbours; what worſhip God requires, and what worſhip God forbids: In this conſideration the Moral Law never ceaſeth in reſpect of any perſon whaſoever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It diſcovers ſinne: For, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>By the Law cometh the knowledge of ſin:</hi> And the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law; for I had not known luſt except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this reſpect likewiſe, the Law is ſtill in force even unto the people of God; it is the glaſs which ſhews them unto themſelves, and the light which manifeſts the hidden things and works of darkneſs in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Rule of life: For as the Goſpel is the Rule of faith, teaching us what to believe; ſo the Moral Law is the Rule of manners, teaching us how to live; and as to this directing power, it is ſtill of force and uſe unto believers: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</hi> Ver. 133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then ſecondly, the Law may be conſidered in reſpect of its circumſtances, not as it is a Rule of obedience, but as it is a condition of life; and as thus conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <note place="margin">How it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It requires a perſonal and perfect obedience, and that under a curſe: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all that is written to do it:</hi> Here now it ceaſeth unto the people of God, the curſing and condemning power is abrogated; <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It requires an exact obedience as a reaſon of Juſtification: <hi>Do this and live:</hi> Here likewiſe the people of God are freed from it; who (as <hi>Luther</hi> well ſpeaks) ſhall not be damned for their evil works, nor yet ſhall be juſtified for their good works: but are juſtified by faith in Chriſt; and the matter of their juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being not inherent righteouſneſs in themſelves, but only the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:55323:340" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Chriſt: Thus you ſee in what reſpects the people of God are freed from, and in what reſpects they are ſtill obliged by the Law: The Law hath not power to condem or juſtifie them, and yet it hath a power to direct and inſtruct them.</p>
                  <p>And that it hath ſuch a power unto which we are to conform our ſelves in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, may appear thus;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By that forementioned place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfill:</hi> And in <note place="margin">Why the Law hath ſtill a power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us.</note> that Chapter he doth both interpret the Law, and commend and command unto his Diſciples the duties of the Law. And ſurely it is no way probable that Chriſt would by his own authority ſo have confirmed the Law, had it been his purpoſe and buſineſs to have cancelled the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. that he might ſhew and clear that in that one precept of love, <hi>He that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law;</hi> produceth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral precepts of the Law in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>For this Thou ſhalt not commit adultery; Thou ſhalt not kill; Thou ſhalt not ſteal; Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs; Thou ſhalt not covet: And if there be any other Commandement, it is briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> All which were a fruitleſs proof, if the Law had nothing to do with the people of God; but utterly ceaſed to them as to point of obedience. In like manner in that place of <hi>James</hi> 2. 8. <hi>If ye fulfill the royal Law according to the Scripture, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, ye do well;</hi> but if the Royal Law were abrogated, certainly they ſhould not have done well to have obſerved it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Moral Precepts were ceaſed as to the people of God, then God would have expreſſed in the delivery of them, a purpoſe after ſome time to have revoked them, and to have exempted his people from further obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or elſe Jeſus Chriſt would himſelf have abrogated them as now unuſeful; but neither of theſe do we find.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Yes, Christ ſaith in</hi> Luke 16. 16. <hi>The Law and the Prophets were untill John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The Law here ſpoken of is not to be underſtood <hi>de Lege Morali,</hi> of the direct and commanding Law of the Moral Law preſcribing obedience, <hi>ſed de lege Prophetante per figur as,</hi> as <hi>Rivet</hi> well obſerves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What ſhall we ſay to that of <hi>Paul?</hi> Rom. 7. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inner man.</hi> And <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. <hi>So then with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God.</hi> And Chap. 8. 4. <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of the Law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> What ſhall we ſay to that of <hi>David?</hi> Pſal. 119. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled who walk in the Law of the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But the Apoſtle ſaith, we are not under the Law, in</hi> Rom. 6 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, One may be ſaid to be under the Law in ſeveral reſpects. <note place="margin">How we are ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law.</note>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. For juſtification by the Law.</item>
                     <item>2. For condemnation by the Law.</item>
                     <item>3. For perfect and perſonal obedience to the Law.</item>
                     <item>4. For a ſlaviſh and ſervile conſtraint: In theſe reſpects the people of God are not under the Law; nevertheleſs for direction and inſtruction to frame their lives unto the precepts of the Law, thus they are under the Law.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But ſecondly, the place to me expounds it ſelf beſt of all: The Apoſtle there ſaith, <hi>We are not under the Law, but under grace;</hi> and this he gives as a reaſon why ſin <hi>ſhould not have dominion over them. We are not under the Law (i. e.)</hi> in ſuch a ſtate where there is only a command given againſt, but no power; <hi>but we are under grace,</hi> which is ſuch a condition or eſtate where beſides a command againſt ſin, we have alſo a power given with that command which pulls down the

                     </gap>e eſtate of believers and regenerate perſons, not in this, that they are utterly freed from the commanding Law of God, but in that they are now under ſuch a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant, vvhere there is not only a Law to command, but grace alſo given to obey.</p>
                  <p>2. Queſt. The next Queſtion is, <hi>what manner of obediential obſervation of God commands that is which concerns the people of God in Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It is an Evangelical manner of obedience or obſervation, which hath four <note place="margin">What obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Gods people.

                  <p>Firſt, It muſt come from Goſpel Principles, even from the life and ſtrength of Chriſt; no man can walk without a Principle of life within him: It is a living work which poceeds from a living Principle: All the obediential work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the people of God are performed in the vertue of their union and communion with Chriſt; <hi>without me you can do nothing:</hi> Chriſt doth not only give the Law unto the people of God, but alſo he gives the Spirit unto them: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I will write my Law in their minds:</hi> He doth by his Spirit write them in their hearts, and makes them complying and willing to obey.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt come from Goſpel motives, even from the mercy and love of God; the people of God do obey him rather as a Father then as a Judge, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">From Goſpel-motives.</note> more at his goodneſs than at his ſeverity: <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs,</hi> Hoſea. 3. 5.

                  <p>Firſt, It is the way which the only wiſe and good God hath conſecrated: It is not a way of mans invention; it is not a way of Satans deluſion; it is the way of God which he himſelf commands, commends, approves, and likes.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, they are wicked and ungodly; they have nothing of Chriſt, or grace, <note place="margin">Such as walk not in Gods ſtatutes, are wicked.</note> or ſpiritual life in them; the Law of God was never witten in their hearts; children of diſobedience are children of wickedneſs; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be:</hi> They were the vileſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who walked <hi>in the vanity of their mind, and were alienated from the life God,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 17, 18.</p>

Secondly, They that refuſe to walk in his ſtatutes, they are proud, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and daring ſinners; it is one of, the higheſt expreſſions of pride, and affront done to God, to turn our backs from him, and to ſet our ſelves againſt him, renouncing his authority over us, and denying all honour unto him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is an inſufferable provocation for any creature to refuſe to walk in the ſtatutes of God, and yet at the ſame time to walk after the commands of the Divel, and his own wicked heart.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But it is impoſſible for any man in the world to walk in the ſtatutes of God, and to keep them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Impoſſible is not the very reaſon why wicked men walk not in Gods ſtatutes; <note place="margin">Why wicked men walk not in Gods ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</note> but the true reaſon in them, is, enmity againſt them; they have a nature which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to be ſubjected to the Law of God, but is at defiance with it, <hi>q. d.</hi> of the holineſs and righteouſneſs in it: Indeed in diſputation, to caſt a blinde, and to gainſay, and to flatter, upon an excuſe for profaneſs or ſlothfulneſs, this is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and urged; O it is impoſſible, and <hi>in many things we ſin all:</hi> But that is not a reaſon or ground, why wicked men walk not in Gods ſtatutes or wayes, but in their ſinful wayes; the very reaſon indeed is this, thier wicked hearts do hate Gods holy and righteous ſtatutes, and do love darkneſs rather then light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If it were abſolutely impoſſible, how is it that we read of all the people of God that they have walked in his ſtatutes and wayes? <hi>Enoch</hi> did ſo, ſo did <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo did <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo did <hi>David,</hi> ſo did <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo did <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſo did <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 23. 1. <hi>I have lived in all good conſcience before God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a twofold walking in Gods ſtatutes; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Legal; which is ſuch an exactneſs of obediential conformity, that there is <note place="margin">What is legal obedience.</note> not the leaſt deviation from the rule, not the leaſt obliquity, or tranſgreſſion, or failing, or ſhortneſs, but the full tale of duty for matter and for manner is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; this I confeſs is actually impoſſible for any man, yea for the beſt on earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Evangelical; which conſiſts. 1. In the application of all the ſtatutes of God as holy and good. 2ly In the exaltation of them; as the Rule to guide our lives, <note place="margin">What is Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and the Paths wherein we will walk. 3ly In the love of them, delighting our ſelves in them. 4ly In an humble and ſincere endeavour to keep them all: This walking in Gods ſtatutes, and keeping of his judgements, is not impoſſible; and there is not a godly man on earth who riſeth not to this: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>We truſt we have a good conſcience in all things, willing to live honeſtly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If this Evangelical walking in Gods ſtatutes be impoſſible to any man, this ariſeth not from the nature of the ſtatutes of God, but from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of mans own nature, which he ſhould beſeech the Lord to heal, and change, and renew by his grace, and then the ſtatutes of God would not be grievous unto him, much leſs would they be impoſſible; he ſhould quickly find that of Chriſt to be true: <hi>Math.</hi> 30. <hi>My yoke is eaſie, and my burden is light.</hi>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. A <hi>Credence,</hi> that there is a God who hath given Laws unto men, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is enjoyned to obey.</item>
                        <item>2. A <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Laws of God which do concern him to keep or obey.</item>

                     <p>1. A <hi>Credence</hi> that there is a God who hath given Laws unto all the ſons of men, and they are bound to keep and obey them.</p>
                     <p>If this Principle (as I have expreſſed it) be not granted, it is in vain to offer any thing concerning walking in Gods ſtatutes, and keeping, and doing of them. If a perſon denies</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is a God, unqueſtionably he doth therein deny all the Lawes or ſtatutes of God, and likewiſe all obedience unto his laws: and hold <note place="margin">Three Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That God hath no authority to preſcribe Laws unto his creatures, or that he never did conſtitute any Laws preſcribing and limiting his creatures, but hath left every man to walk in the wayes of his own heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Though he hath ſet Laws and Rules of life, yet his creatures are at their own liberty to obey them, or not obey them, if he obey them it is well; and if they pleaſe not to obey them, there is no ſin or danger.</p>

I ſay ſuch <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Poſitions as theſe do utterly void all the ſoveraignty of God, and obligations of man, and are the foundations of all wickedneſs and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; therefore of neceſſity if any perſon would walk in the ſtatutes of God, and do them, he muſt be really and fully convinced of theſe three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a God,</hi> a true and living God, the Maker and poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, who is the Lord and Soveraign of all men; to whom the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of making laws for them doth of right belong; for he indeed hath the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and higheſt power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That he hath given Laws or ſtatutes unto all the ſons of men,</hi> in which he reveals his mind, will, and pleaſure concerning them, what he would have them to do, and what he would have them to avoid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That thoſe Laws or ſtatutes of his, are Obligations upon men;</hi> they do not only teach what is good and evil, but bind us alſo to do that good, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline that evil: The Lord God being bound to uphold his own will and glory, and having threatned all tranſgreſſors of his Laws, and revealed his wrath againſt them, and hath puniſhed them, and ſtill hath in readineſs to avenge the diſobedience of men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When you do believe that there is a God who hath authority to preſcribe Laws unto you, and that he hath enacted and publiſhed them for all men to take notice of them; then muſt you give diligence to know what his Laws are concerning you, and to underſtand them, that you may be able to ſay concerning your ſelves what the Apoſtle ſpake of others, <hi>This is the will of God concerning you.</hi> Pſal. 119. 27. <hi>Make me to underſtand the way of thy precepts.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes that I may behold the wondrous things out of thy Law.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy ſtatutes.</hi> Iſa. 2. 3. <hi>Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his wayes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now here briefly are two Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>1. Queſt. <hi>What kind of knowledge of Gods ſtatutes is requiſite towards our</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A threefold knowledge of Gods ſtatutes.</note> 
                        <hi>walking in them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a threefold knowledge of them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A knowledge of apprehenſion, which is partly</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Literal;</hi> this is the leaſt and weakeſt part of our knowledge, when a man <note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and this is of that Law which is in the Law; it is a knowledge of <note place="margin">Spiritual knowledge</note> the true meaning and purpoſe of any Law or ſtatute of God: Many know li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, who yet know not ſpiritually, ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to dive into, and reach the meaning of God. <hi>e. g. Thou ſhalt have none other Gods but me,</hi> Exod. 20. 3. Theſe letters and words are known by many, and yet the ſenſe of them is known only to a few, namely that we muſt ſet up the true God only for our God, and make him the only object of our truſt, and love, and fear: Now look on this Law in the true ſenſe and ſpiritual interpretation thereof, as particularly binding our ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>A knowledge of approbation:</hi> Though a man doth know the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part and intent of Gods Laws, yet if his ſoul riſes up againſt them as <note place="margin">A knowledge of approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> cruel, as unjuſt, as vain, and unprofitable, ſuch a knowledge as this (conjoyned with diſlike and exception) will never conduce to our obedience or walking in them, but rather to diſobedience; to the knowledge of apprehenſion joyn the knowledge
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:55323:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of approbation; our judgements muſt comply with, and acknowledge that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellency and equity in the ſtatutes of God: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>The Law is holy, and the Commandement holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> Pſal. 119. 138. <hi>Thy teſtimonies which thou haſt commanded us are righteous, and very faithful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A knowledge of Application; we muſt know the ſtatutes of God, <note place="margin">A knowledge of Applicatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </note> and approve of them as righteous and good, and alſo we muſt apply the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and goodneſs of them to our ſelves <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that they do concern every of us in particular, as obliging of us, and good for us.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Eliphas ſpake</hi> to <hi>Job;</hi> Job. 5. 27. <hi>Lo this we have ſearched, ſo it is, hear thou i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, and know thou it for thy good:</hi> So ſay I, you muſt hear and know the ſtatutes of God, how righteous they are, how good they are, how bleſſed they are, what a command and power they have, and this you muſt apply unto your ſelves, not only as belonging to others, and ſpeaking to others, but as belonging alſo to your ſelves, to order your lives by them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 4. <hi>Thou haſt commanded to keep thy precepts diligently.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keep thy ſtatutes!</hi> When you know that Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord in vain;</hi> or that Commandement, <hi>Remember to keep holy the Sabbath day, &amp;c.</hi> You muſt know theſe Commandements as reſpecting you, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging you, that you muſt not ſwear, and that you muſt not break the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> but that you muſt know the Name of God, and ſanctifie the day of God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. Queſt. <hi>What can knowledge contribute towards a walking in Gods ſtatutes, &amp;c? for many know them, and yet do not, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this, take briefly theſe Anſwers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Though poſſibly a man may know the ſtatutes of God, and yet not walk <note place="margin">How know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> in them, yet that knowledge is no cauſe of it: Knowledge is in itſelf a help and furtherance to walking (as the light is to working) it is not any hinderance at all; that which hinders knowing perſons from obedience, is not the light of their knowledge, but the luſt of their corrupt affections which bear down their knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Without knowledge of the ſtatutes of God, that which we call duty or obedience, is neither practical nor acceptable.</p>
                     <p>1. It is not practical: Knowledge is a neceſſary previous quality unto acts <note place="margin">Without knowledge obedience is not practical.</note> of duty. It is impoſſible to obey the will of God, if we know not the will of God: Can a ſervant do the will of his Maſter who knows not the will of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? our obedience (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.) is called a <hi>reaſonable ſervice;</hi> and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it cannot be without knowledge; without knowledge it is rather brutiſh than reaſonable.</p>
                     <p>2. It cannot be acceptable: The Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. That <hi>without</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Nor accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> 
                        <hi>Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> But faith there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without knowledge, there cannot be Faith for the acceptance of duty, unleſſe firſt there be a knowledge of Gods Command of that duty.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is an aptitude of knowledge of things to be done, to put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the doing of thoſe things: For knowledge is a Spiritual light, and ſpiritual light it is not only Repreſentative, but alſo operative; it will work upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and will, and affections to draw them up to that performance of what is known: This you ſee in enlightned ſinners, who are made to ſee the will or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, that the light hath an influence upon their hearts and conſciences and ſervices, to excuſe or condemn them, and ſo ſtill it doth untill they do impriſon or extinguiſh that light.</p>
                     <p>4. At leaſt knowledge may ſerve your thus far, to put you upon prayer, to ſeek the Lord to give you an heart to walk in his ſtatutes: If it be not able to make you to walk in his ſtatutes, yet it is in ſome meaſure conducing to lead out
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:55323:345" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your deſires to the Lord to write his Laws in your hearts, and to cauſe you to walk in his ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As you muſt get the knowledge of Gods ſtatutes if you would walk in <note place="margin">We muſt have our hearts and wills ſanctified, if we will keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</note> them; ſo likewiſe you muſt get your hearts and wills ſanctified. Our walking in Gods ſtatutes, is ſtiled <hi>newneſs of life:</hi> Rom. 6. 4. <hi>That we ſhould walk in newneſs of life;</hi> and a ſervice <hi>in newneſs of Spirit,</hi> Rom. 7. 6. implying the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a new ſpirit towards a new life: You know that to the walking in Gods ſtatutes, there muſt be 1. A ſubordination of our wills to Gods will; Gods will muſt not go one way, and our wills run another way: If our wlls be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his, this is a plain diſobedience: But now to reduce our will to the way of God; this requires holineſs or renovation in our wills, foraſmuch as the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will is enmity to the Law of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. 2ly A conformity or ſimilitude; our walking and Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Precepts muſt agree; what is to be found in Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that muſt be found in our practice, elſe it is not a walking in his ſtattutes; you do not ſet them up as your Rule, as your Copy, if you do not commenſurate your actions by them, and to both theſe, holineſs of heart is required: For the heart muſt be ſanctified and renewed, or elſe it can neither yield up it ſelf, nor conform itſelf to that holy will of God; conſider that paſſage of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 2. <hi>Through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience:</hi> why doth not the Apoſtle ſay, election to obedience, but <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience?</hi> not that we are not elected unto obedience, but that there can be no obedience without the ſanctification of the Spirit; As there can be no action of life without a principle of life; ſo there can be no actions of Spiritual life, without the great principle of holineſs in the heart; and when God puts that holy diſpoſition into our hearts, this will as ſweetly incline us to walk in the ſtatutes of God, as we were wont to be enclined to walk in ways of wickedneſs when we were under the power of an unholy and ſinful diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Four things a man ſhall find when once his heart is indeed ſanctified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. <note place="margin">What we ſhall find when our hearts are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. An abhorring of every evil way contrary to Gods ſtatutes: <hi>I hate all falſe ways,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. A way of wickedneſs is no way for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Complyance with every good way, and path appointed by God for us to walk in: <hi>I eſteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right,</hi> Pſal. 119. 128. And ver. 173. <hi>I have choſen thy precepts.</hi>

                     <p>O ſirs, the Law of God is againſt a wicked heart, and a wicked heart is againſt the Law of God! that is holy, but his heart is unholy; for that there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between them, but a perpetual enmity and contrariety; the Law threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens his ſinful luſts and wayes, and his heart deſpiſeth and oppoſeth the Law <hi>q. d.</hi> it is holy, and therefore contrary to his unholy heart. And therefore of neceſſity this unholineſs muſt be taken away (and no other way can it be removed but by the ſanctifying of the heart) before a man can or will walk in Gods ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If you would walk in the ſtatutes of God, then you muſt get an Evangelical ſaith, as Chriſt ſpake in another caſe unto that troubled man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 19. 23. <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth:</hi>
                        <pb n="657" facs="tcp:55323:345"/>
that ſay I concerning walking in Gods ſtatutes; if we could believe, had we faith, and could we act it aright, our obedience would be poſſible to us, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God.</p>
                     <p>That there is a neceſſity of this faith, and likewiſe an efficacy, for our walking <note place="margin">The neceſſity of faith, if we will walk in Gods wayes.</note> in Gods ſtatutes, may thus appear.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is that grace which unites us unto Chriſt, in whom there is a fulneſs of grace, and likewiſe a fulneſs of ſtrength: As we have no grace but what comes from Chriſt, ſo we have no ſtrength but what comes from him; <hi>without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5.) <hi>ye can do nothing;</hi> if we can do nothing without Chriſt, then certainly we cannot obey, we cannot walk in Gods ſtatutes without him; and therefore faith is neceſſary for this obediential walking, becauſe without Chriſt we can do nothing, and becauſe without faith we have nothing to do with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is the grace of life: <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20.) <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God:</hi> We never live (Spiritually) untill we do believe; for Chriſt is our life by faith; upon this account faith is neceſſary to our obediential walking, becauſe ſuch a walking is impoſſible without a ſpiritually vital principle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is that grace by which we do receive the Spirit: We receive the <hi>promiſe of the Spirit through Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 14. But without the Spirit there is no poſſible walking in God ſtatutes; becauſe all the power and might that we have to do any good (as you may ſhortly hear) comes from the preſence and aſſiſtance of the Spirit, who is in a ſoule <hi>all in all,</hi> in all the good which we do perform.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is the grace which applies all the promiſes of help and ſtrength, and which brings in all your aſſiſtance from Chriſt: You know that God doth promiſe his help for our work: <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>I will ſtrengthen them in the Lord, and they ſhall walk up and down in his Name, ſaith the Lord;</hi> and ſo here in the Text, <hi>I will cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> Ezek. 36.

As in Prayer, there are the words of prayer, and there is the Spirit of Prayer; and in hearing of the Word, there is the meer hearing, and there is the right hearing, or the ſpiritual hearing of the Word. Now we muſt take heed that we content not our ſelves with the meer outward doing of any duty, becauſe</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God requires more then the meer outward work: <hi>My ſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>give</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now there are four things which demonſtrate that men do perform duties in a formal manner, and content themſelves with the meer <hi>opus operatum.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why do men reſt in the work done. Its an eaſie ſervice.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is the facility of their obedience: To perform any one duty, to make any one prayer in a ſpiritual manner, will coſt us much care and watchfulneſs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny workings of heart, many workings of faith, and fear; but to perform duties in a carnal, formal way coſts a man nothing; if he can but read, or ſay his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, this is all, and there he reſts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond is, the deadneſs of the ſervices: It is a ſervice without any heart <note place="margin">Its a dead ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> at all; the underſtanding acts not, and the will acts not, and the affections act not in it; the man confeſſeth ſin without any grief of heart for ſin, and even prays for grace and mercy without any longing deſires, or faith in Chriſt or the promiſes to obtain it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A careleſneſs of ſervice: The formal man minds not God, nor any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <note place="margin">A careleſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> with him, and minds not prayer, and minds nothing beyond prayer, whether his own heart be right or no, and whether God regards him, and anſwers him, this he minds not.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fruitleſneſs of doing: Nothing comes of the formal work of duty; the man ſaith a prayer, but no good comes of it, and he hears, but no good comes of it, <note place="margin">A fruitleſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> ſtill he prayes, and ſtill he hears, and ſtill he reads, and ſtill he is drunk, and ſtill he ſwears, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You muſt take heed of neutrality in walking in Gods ſtatutes; neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality <note place="margin">Take heed of neutrality.</note> is an indifferent participation of both extreams; it hath ſomething of the one, and ſomething of the other, as luke-warm water, hath ſomething of heat, and ſomething of cold: So the man who is guilty of neutrality in walking in Gods ſtatutes, he hath one foot in the wayes of God, and another foot in the wayes of wickedneſs, <hi>he halts between two Opinions;</hi> he is not only for God, nor only for <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 King. 18. 21. he is not altogether for Gods commands, nor altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſins commands, but he devides himſelf betwixt God and his ſinful luſts; he will pray, but withall he will ſwear; and he will hear the Word, but withall he will be drunk; he will do many things that are good, but withall he will do many things that are wicked. Now take heed of this; God cannot endure it. <hi>If God be God, follow him:</hi> 1 King. 18. 21. <hi>You ſhall walk in my ſtatutes,</hi> ſaith God here <hi>(i. e.)</hi> you ſhall ſet me up alone, and my commands alone, and my wayes alone. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>I will cut off them that ſwear by the Lord, and that ſwear by Malcham.</hi> Rev. 3. 16. <hi>Becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth.</hi> Matth. 4. 10. <hi>It is written thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You muſt take heed of partiality in walking in Gods ſtatutes: We ſay <note place="margin">Take heed of partiality.</note> that <hi>Lex eſt copulativa;</hi> God doth not ſay you ſhall do this, or do that, you ſhall

                     <p>Fourthly, You muſt take heed of reſting or relying upon any of your works or <note place="margin">Take heed of reſting upon duties.</note> duties; you muſt endeavour obedience unto Gods Law, but you muſt beware of placing your confidence upon that obedience: You muſt pray, and read, and hear, and mourn, and repent, and walk holily and humbly with your God; and you muſt live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly, and fear the Lord, and love the Lord, and obey his voice, and when you have done ſo to your utmoſt, and to your beſt, then muſt you caſt your Crowns to the ground, and weep that you have ſerved your God no more, and no better, and cry out with the <hi>Publican, God be merciful to me a ſinner!</hi> and with <hi>David, Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified,</hi> Pſal. 143. 2.

                     <p>Fifthly, You muſt take heed of performing duties, or obeying Gods ſtatutes <note place="margin">Take heed of falſe ends.</note> for falſe ends; As 1.

                     <p>Secondly, You muſt not do any good work, thinking thereby to ſatisfie God for your evil works: Many people when they have committed ſin, and injured <note place="margin">Nor to ſatisfie God for our ſins.</note> and diſhonoured God, then they fall a praying, and a reading, and a hearing, and put on to works of piety, and charity, and their intention or end in doing of theſe duties is to make God amends, and to make up the wrong which they have done him, ſuppoſing that the good which now they do, will ballance the evil which they have done, and ſatisfie God: Now though this be true, that our ſinnings do injure God, and therefore its reaſon that after our ſinnings we ſhould be much humbled, and be more circumſpect in our walking, and more diligent and upright: Yet to act all theſe as ſatisfactions to God for the ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious workes which we have done againſt him, This is 1. Fooliſh. 2ly Sinful.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is fooliſh, foraſmuch as nothing that we can do, can amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Its fooliſh.</note> a ſatisfaction for the evil that we can do; Becauſe</p>
                     <p>1. All the good which we now do, we ought ſtill to have done; and that which <note place="margin">Reaſons of it.</note> was ſtill a duty, can never be a ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>There is more evil in the evil that we have done, than there is good in the good which we do; our ſinful evil is perfectly evil, and our beſt good is but imperfect good:</hi> The evil that we do againſt God, deſerves hell; and the good which we do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves nothing; the evil which is done needs infinite mercies to pardon it; and the good which we do, is ſo mixt with our ſinfulneſs, that that alſo needs mercy to pardon and accept it; and that which needs mercy cannot be a ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is ſinful: <hi>For this is to take upon us the work of a Mediatour, to whom alone that work of ſatisfaction doth pertain; and he muſt be both God and</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>You muſt not offer up any performances of yours as cauſes of mercy and</hi>

                     <p>There are four things to be obſerved about mercies and bleſſings. <note place="margin">What is to be obſerved about mercies and bleſſings.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Efficient Cauſe;</hi> and that is only Gods own love, and grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; his own glorious love is the only efficient cauſe of all our bleſſings whether ſpiritual or temporal.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Meritorious Cauſe;</hi> and that is Jeſus Chriſt, who by his blood hath purchaſed all things for us <hi>pertaining to life and godlineſs.</hi>

                     <p>In two caſes ſome men ſet upon works of obedience only to ſtill and quiet conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>One is the caſe of education and custome:</hi> They have been brought up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, and have been accuſtomed to read, and pray; and if at any time they do neglect and omit theſe duties, conſcience is upon them and upbraids and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets them; and they are afraid to neglect them, leſt conſcience will queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and trouble them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Another is the caſe of tranſgreſſion;</hi> when men have committed ſome great ſin againſt God, thereupon conſcience becomes impatient, and accuſeth, and condemns, and terrifies them; and now they fall a praying, and mourning, and confeſſing, and reforming, but all this is to quiet conſcience, and they do find ſometimes that under theſe performances, their conſciences are a little allayed and quieted, and for that end do thoſe take them up as a charm to allay their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and when their conſciences are quieted, then they lay aſide ſtrictneſs of walking in Gods ſtatutes, and all ſincere care of obedience, and are ready to tranſgreſs again. O take heed of this; this is but hypocriſie, and this will end in hardneſs of heart at the laſt: He that performs duties only to quiet conſcience that it ſhall not accuſe him for ſin, will at length venture upon a courſe of high tranſgreſſions againſt conſcience, and will turn his troubled conſcience into a ſeared conſcience.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Remember (by the way) theſe three hints.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Many men do not mind the pleaſing of God, nor his acceptance in what <note place="margin">Some mind not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God.</note> they do; they bring their gift to the Altar and there they leave it, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God accepts it at their hands, and be well-pleaſed with what they have done, they mind it not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Many think that if a good work be done, God muſt needs be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it. What! God commands Prayer, and yet not accepts of it, nor be <note place="margin">Others think that God muſt needs be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their works.</note> pleaſed with it!</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, <hi>God requires the manner as well as the matter;</hi> and the work done is not accepted if it be not done aright; did not the Lord command ſacrifice, and did not <hi>Cain</hi> ſacrifice? <hi>yet God had no reſpect to him nor his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Gen. 4. 5. Did not God command prayer unto the <hi>Jews?</hi> yet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>When you ſpread forth your hearts I will hide mine eyes from you; yea when you make many prayers I will not hear;</hi> why ſo? <hi>for your hands are full of blood;</hi> therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 66. 18.) <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is a great judgement, when neither a perſon nor his works are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God and pleaſe him not; when the Lord ſaith, <hi>my ſoul hath no</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Its a great judgement not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God.</note> 
                        <hi>pleaſure in him,</hi> and I regard not his prayings, nor his faſtings, nor readings, nor hearings, nor any good he doth: If God regards not thee nor thy good works, how doth he abhor thee and thy wicked works; if he will condemn thee for them, what will he do unto thee for theſe? Many ignorant ſuperſtitious creatures have high thoughts of their good meanings, and of their devout ſerving of God, and place all their confidence upon them: But when they give up their accounts, they will find that none of theſe were pleaſing to God, nor accepted of him: <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I never knew you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, I will now ſhew unto you</p>

To ponder, is to weigh and to conſider well of what we are about to do, whether it be agreeable or diſagreeable to the will of God; what the work or way is, for the nature of it, and ſcope, and end of it. Thus ſhould we ponder the path of our feet <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the wayes wherein we walk, and all the works we have to do; and have a care that they be eſtabliſhed <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſet upon a good foundation, and really allowed by God, and commanded in his VVord; and then we ſhould go on in thoſe wayes without ſwerving to the right hand or to the left: A ſeriouſneſs of conſideration how God would have us to walk, what his will is concerning us, and then a ſeriouſneſs of obſervation, conſcientiouſly to do what God would have us to do, and to walk as God would have us to walk; this is the right and acceptable walking in Gods ſtatutes.</p>

                        </gap>iverſal obedience, conſider theſe ſix Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, They that are for a partial obedience to Gods Commands, and for a <note place="margin">Partial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence breaks the bond of all obedience.</note> walking in ſome of his ſtatutes only, they do break aſunder the Bond and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all obedience: All obedience is to be founded upon the Authority and will of God, becauſe God (who hath authority over all his creatures) doth will and command us to obey his voice, to walk in his ſtatutes; for this very reaſon do we ſtand bound to obey him: And if we do obey him upon this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then muſt we walk in all his ſtatutes, for ſo hath he commanded us; and if we will not come up to this, but will walk in what ſtatutes of his we pleaſe, then do we renounce his will as the obliging reaſon of our obedience, and do ſet up our own liking and pleaſure as the reaſon thereof.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Nay ſecondly it tends to plain <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> For by the ſame reaſon <note place="margin">It tends to Atheiſme.</note> that you ſlight the will of God in any Commandement; by the ſame reaſon you may deſpiſe his will in every Commandement, for every Commandement of God is his will, and it is holy and ſpiritual, and contrary to our ſinful luſts, and if this be the reaſon why ſuch and ſuch Commandements of God will not down with you, then by the ſamereaſon none of them muſt be of authority with you.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is an audacious charge againſt God himſelf, as to his wiſdome, or <note place="margin">Its an audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charge againſt God himſelf.</note> power, or goodneſs; thoſe ſtatutes of God which you will not come up unto, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are righteous as the reſt, and are good as the reſt, or they are not: If they be alſo righteous and good, why ſhould we not walk in them as in the reſt? If they be not righteous and good, O what a blaſphemous charge is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt God in preſcribing unto him any thing that is not righteous and good? and likewiſe in making his will (which is the rule of righteouſneſs and goodneſs) to be partly righteous, and partly unrighteous, to be partly good, and partly bad?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is not any one ſtatute of God, but it is good, and for our <note place="margin">All the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are good, and for our good.</note> good; <hi>Ergo</hi> we ſhould walk in all his ſtatutes: <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Ye ſhall walk in all the wayes which the Lord your God hath commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you.</hi> What one path hath the Lord commanded us to walk in, but as it concerns his own glory, ſo likewiſe it concerns our good? Is it not good for us to love and fear the Lord, and to put our truſt in him, and to worſhip and ſerve him after his own mind and will, and to honour his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name, and to ſanctifie his day? how many bleſſings hath God promiſed unto ſuch? and to honour our Parents, and forſake all thoſe ſinnes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Negative Precepts, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Our hearts muſt be perfect with the Lord our God: <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 13. <note place="margin">Our hearts ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with the Lord.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Now how can our hearts be ſaid to be perfect with God, if we do prevaricate with him? if in ſome things we will obey him, and in other things we will not obey him; if we walk in ſome of his ſtatutes, but will not walk in all his ſtatutes; if in ſome part we will be his ſervants, and in other parts of our lives we will be the ſervants of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, Either we muſt endeavour to walk in all the ſtatutes of God, or elſe we muſt find ſome diſpenſation and toleration from God, to free <note place="margin">God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted us from none.</note> us, and excuſe us, and hold us indemnified, though we do not walk in all of them; now what one Commandement is there from obedience whereunto God excuſeth any man? or will not puniſh him for the neglect of obedience unto it: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2. 10. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> If he prevaricates with God as to any one particular Commandement of his, his heart is naught, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all, he hath really no regard of any of the reſt of Gods Laws. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the Lords ſake, conſider of this all of you that hear me this day, and let
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:55323:352"/>
your ſouls be humbled within you for your looſe and unfaithful walking in Gods ſtatutes: One will not pray, another will ſwear, another will not ſet up religious duties in his family, another will not keep the Sabbath day holy, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will cheat and over-reach his neighbor, another will lye and ſpeak evil, and back-bite, &amp;c. Is this to walk in all the ſtatutes of God? is this fully to walk in all his wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But it is impoſſible for any man on earth to walk in all Gods ſtatutes,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Its impoſſible.</note> 
                        <hi>and fully to do his will.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, there is a twofold walking in all the ſtatutes of God;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, One is <hi>Legal,</hi> when all is done which God requireth; and all is done as God requireth; There is not any one path of duty, but we do walk in it <note place="margin">A Legal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note> perfectly and continually; thus no man on earth doth, or can walk in all Gods ſtatutes, or fully do what he commandeth; <hi>for in many things we offend all:</hi> it was but a proud, vain ſelf-deluſion in that young man who ſaid, <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my youth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another is <hi>Evangelical;</hi> which is ſuch a walking in all the ſtatutes of God, and keeping of them, as is in Chriſt accepted of, and accounted of <note place="margin">But Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal is poſſible.</note> as if we did keep them all, (this walking in all Gods ſtatutes, and keeping of them all, and doing of them all, it is not only poſſible, but it is alſo actual in every freely believing and repenting perſon) and it doth conſiſt in theſe Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the approbation of all the ſtatutes and Commandements of God: <note place="margin">A believer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of all.</note>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This being granted that we muſt ſhew reſpect unto all Gods ſtatutes; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is not neceſſary, nor are we bound to expreſs the ſame equal reſpect to all Gods Commandements. For although all the Commandements of God be equal in reſpect of authority and Soveraignty of the commands, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the things commanded or forbidden, and in reſpect of the ſtrictneſs of the charge laid upon us for the doing or not doing of them, ſome are greater than others: <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 36. <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſaid the Lawyer to Chriſt) <hi>which is the great Commandement in the Law?</hi> Ver. 37. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind.</hi> Ver. 38. <hi>This is the firſt and great Commandement.</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22. <hi>And Samuel ſaid, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?

                     <p>Thirdly, Of thoſe which are the bond and ſinews of all Religion, upholding it in the power and practice of it; as the ſanctifying of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, we ſhould walk in Gods ſtatutes, and keep, and do them affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; we ſhould affect the acts of obedience, and be affected in them; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a man did walk up to every ſtatute of God, yet if this were not done affectionately, all were nothing. Now there are four affections with which we ſhould perform every ſervice or duty that we do unto God.</p>
                     <p>1. Love and delight. 2ly Joy. 3ly Fear. 4ly Zeal.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, With <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Delight:</hi> We muſt love the Lord and his ſtatutes, and the <note place="margin">With love and delight.</note> duties which he requires from us, and take delight in obeying, and doing his will: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> Ver. 167. <hi>My ſoul hath kept thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and I love them exceedingly.</hi> Pſal. 40 8. <hi>I delight to do thy will O my God, yea thy Law is within my heart.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, With <hi>fear: Serve the Lord with fear,</hi> Pſal. 2. 11. when ye are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <note place="margin">With fear.</note> any duty to God, ye muſt do it with a</p>

                        </gap> diſcoveries of this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The prevalent motive which alone ſufficeth to his obedience, and that <note place="margin">If we obey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commands.</note> is the will or command of God; if a man be upright, and walk with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart, then he will, and doth act and move upon the ſole account of Gods command; that alone is reaſon enough and will prevail with him for obedience. There are ſeveral Motives which induce men to do good works; ſome do reſpect our ſelves, and are drawn from a reſpect to our credit, and profit, as do ſuch a work, and perform ſuch a duty, and you ſhall have honour amongſt men by it, and you ſhall gain much by it; theſe conſiderations are the prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which men of unſound hearts to ſome things which God requires, as it was with <hi>Jehu, &amp;c.</hi> And ſome are drawn from God himſelf, only from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and this is ſufficient, and this prevails with men of upright heart: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 4. <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy precepts dilgently.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keep thy ſtatutes!</hi> Mark how his heart is drawn out to obedience upon the meer command of God: <hi>Thou haſt commanded us, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 2. 3. <hi>He will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> Mark, there is no more conſidered to move to walk in his paths than this, <hi>he will teach us of his wayes (i. e.)</hi> he will make us to know that this or that is his will and command concerning us. <hi>Paul</hi> relates that it was the earneſt prayer of <hi>Epaphras</hi> for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they <hi>might ſtand perfect, and be filled with all the will of God,</hi> Col. 4. 12.

                        </gap>: Some look upon that word as <hi>Metaphorical (to be filled with the will of God)</hi> as the ſails of a ſhip are filled with wind, which is enough to carry the ſhip in voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; ſo it is enough when the will of God fills our hearts, and that carries them out to duty; and <hi>David</hi> hath a ſingular expreſſion in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>When I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements;</hi> you know that to have a reſpect unto a thing, is this, when that of all other ſwayes moſt with us, as when a Maſter commands a ſervant, he will do ſuch a buſineſs, becauſe he reſpects him, and at his command he will go and come, though he will not at the command of any other; this was <hi>Davids</hi> temper, he had <hi>reſpect to Gods Commandements;</hi> they had authority over him, he had a regard to them; therefore conſider well what is the Motive which induces you to pray, to hear, to do any other good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; is it Gods will or Commandement alone? if it be not ſo, you walk not, you act not uprightly.</p>
                     <p>Object. But will ſome reply, <hi>This is ſomething difficult to diſcern, foraſmuch</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How to know whether we act upon Gods command alone.</note> 
                        <hi>as Gods command and our own intereſts may meet, they may concur ſometimes in ſome actions to be done; and now it will be hard to know whether we act upon the command of God alone.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, The ſingleneſs of the path: when a man walks in Gods ſtatutes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, <note place="margin">If the Word be your Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Bond of the Covenant twixt God and them, wherein there is, <note place="margin">From the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Covenant.</note> 1. A mutuall Agreement. 2. The date of the Agreement. The Agreement is that <hi>God will be their God,</hi> And that <hi>they will be his people:</hi> God will be theirs, and they will be his: They will ſerve him and he will bleſs them. The date of this Agreement is Everlaſting, <hi>I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with you, I will never turne a way from them to do them good, and I will put my fear into their hearts that they ſhall never depart from me:</hi> Jer. 32. 40. Pſal. 48. 14. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever, he will be our guid even unto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I infer two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Relation 'twixt God and his people doth ſtill continue, then the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation <note place="margin">The relation betwixt God and his People ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>. The Covenant takes hold of God to bleſs them.</note> ſtill continues; if they do ſtill own him for their God, they muſt ſtill obey and ſerve him as their God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Covenant takes hold of God to bleſs them and do them good, it doth by the ſame reaſon take hold on them ſtill to ſerve and obey their God: It were abſurd to think that the obligation ſhould be only on God's part, and not on our part; or that it ſhould be at all times on Gods part to do us good, and only at ſome time on our part to do him ſervice.</p>
                  <p>There are three things conſiderable in the Statutes or Commands of God. <note place="margin">What conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Gods Statutes. A Bredth in them. A Hight in them. A Length in them.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a Bredth in them; for they are many and do require manifold du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and our hearts and lives muſt have a reſpect unto them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Height in them. they are Laws of perfection, and we ſhould ſtrive to come up fully unto them, to the utmoſt of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a Length in them, they extend in their Authority and power from the firſt day of life to the laſt minute of breath; and our obedience unto them ſhould be conſtant unto them: ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>The woman that hath an husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is bound by the Law to her husband ſo long as he liveth:</hi> So ſay the people of God who are in Covenant with him and take him for their Lord and Husband, they are bound to obey his laws, and walk in his ſtatutes preſcribed to them as long as the husband lives, at leaſt as long as they ſhall live. Thus you ſee that the people of God are to hold on and to continue unto the end in the duties of obedience; it muſt be the work of their whole life to walk in God's ſtatutes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The force of Gods Law: The morall law of God (for of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <note place="margin">From the force of Gods Law.</note>
                     <pb n="676" facs="tcp:55323:355" rendition="simple:additions"/>
only ſpeak) it is an Eternal law, it is not Temporary, and Ceſſant, ſet up to be of force for a time only: No, it is a fixed and ſtanding Rule, and hath authority over us, not for ſome part of our life, but for all the dayes of our life: and we are to order not only ſome part of our converſations, but our whole converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according unto it; <hi>order my ſteps in thy word, Pſal.</hi> 119. 133. We do finde that the laws or Commandements of God, ſome of them are affirmative, and ſome of them are negative; the affirmative do binde us <hi>Semper,</hi> and the negative do binde us <hi>Semper &amp; ad Semper.</hi> There is no time diſpenſed with to ſin againſt God, no time to take the Name of God in vain, no time to commit adultery, no time to kill or ſteal, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And though the affirmative precepts do not bind us at all times as to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acts, yet they do ſtill bind us to ſome acts of obedience: As though God will at ſome times diſpence with ſacrifice, yet then it is in caſe of mercy: As if a fire ſhould break out on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, God ſuffers us to omit his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but this is that we might obſerve him in acts of mercy at this time: Well then! the Law of God is never out of date, and therefore our obedience ſhould be never out of date. This Command lies upon us for our whole life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obedience lies upon us for our whole life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is ſtill an imperfection upon us, and therefore ſtill there is need <note place="margin">Whilſt we live we are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> of further obedience. Take me the beſt Chriſtian on earth, there is ſtill imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon him; and there is nothing which he doth, but ſtill he may do it better. He doth not ſo beleive on God, but he needs ſtill to believe, and ſtill to believe better. He doth not ſo love his God, but he needs ſtill to love his God, and to love him more. He doth not ſo ſanctifie a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but he needs ſtill to keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day holy, and to keep it more holy. He doth not ſo pray and hear and mourne, but he needs ſtill to pray and hear, and to pray and hear bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He doth not ſo mortify his ſins, and reform his heart and life, but he needs every day to be mortifying his ſinfull luſts, and reforming and mending his heart more and more, further and further. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Our Safety. You are never more ſafe then when you are in Gods <note place="margin">Our ſafety.</note> way: The path of obedience is the path of Safety. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 6. <hi>Righteouſneſs keepeth him that is upright in the way, but wickedneſs overthroweth the ſinner.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>He that keepeth his way preſerveth his ſoul:</hi> 19. 16. <hi>He that keepeth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, keepeth his own ſoul: But he that deſpiſeth his wayes ſhall dye.</hi> Eccle. 8. 5. <hi>Whoſe keepeth the Commandements ſhall ſee no evil things.</hi> But look on the very imployment of life in the whole courſe of it, can it be better imployed or ſpent then in an obediential walking with God?

God, nor a more choice imployment of our life than in his ſervice: Communion with God is our happineſs in this life, and in the life to come. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 1. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of hoſts!</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, they will be ſtill prayſing thee.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>A day in thy courts is better than a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and; I had rather be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The further you proceed in walking in the paths of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <note place="margin">The farther we go in theſe wayes, they are the better. We ſhall have the clearer knowledg of them.</note> the better you ſhall finde it to walke in them.</p>
                  <p>There are four things which may demonſtrate this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the farther that you proceed in the wayes of God, the clearer knowledge you ſhall attain to, both of God and of his wayes; the more we do obey him, the better we ſhall know him, and love him, and be beloved of him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandements and keepeth them, he it is that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my father; and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the further we proceed in the wayes of God, the further teſtimony ſhall we have from conſcience that our hearts are upright. There is (you know) <note place="margin">And fuller teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from Conſcience.</note> much of our happineſs or unhappineſs, in the teſtimony of conſcience; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right walking gives a great advantage unto conſcience to ſpeak on our behalfe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the way of the Lord,</hi> and ver. 2. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his teſtimonies, and ſeek him with the whole heart.</hi> Now affectionate walking, and ſtedfaſt walking, do ſhew that our hearts are upright in walking.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe the farther we do proceed in walking in Gods ſtatutes, the more <note place="margin">And the more ſweet experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> ſweet and heavealy experiences ſhall our ſoules meet with. Still you meet with promiſes, but if you make farther progreſs, you ſhall meet with the fruits and effects of thoſe promiſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto ſuch as keep his covenants and his teſtimonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe the further that you do proceed to walk in Gods Statutes, the <note place="margin">And the neerer we are to our journeyes end.</note> neerer you are to the journies end, and to the crown of life: <hi>It is but one ſtile more, and then I am at my fathers houſe;</hi> but a few ſteps more, and then <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi> Math. 25. 21.</p>

                  <p>But Secondly, All that are ſincere, they do ſo, they are ſtill walking on in the Statutes of God. I told you lately, that particular actions do not denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any eſtate; it is the courſe of actions which doth denominate our walking. Though a wicked man doth ſometimes a particular good, yet this man ſtill walks in his iniquities, becauſe the courſe of his life is ſpent in the path of ſin.

                     <p>2 At leaſt, that much obedience, and conſtant or continued obedience is that path; ſome little ſervice, for a little time (if men have any to ſpare) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is; but to ſpend a whole life in holy walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And take one thing more; that never did any fall off, or turn away from walking in Gods ſtatutes, but he grew far more wicked then ever he was before, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a deſperate enemies to the wayes of God.</p>
                     <p>3ly <hi>Their great danger and judgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I ſhall ſhew unto you in three Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Revolters or Apoſtates are judicially given up to the great power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: <note place="margin">The great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. They are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> The Lord doth in his juſt judgement give them over unto Satan that he ſhould rule them, and that they ſhould be his ſworn ſervants who will break off with God, and refuſe to ſerve him any longer: <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. <hi>That unclean ſpirit returned unto his houſe from whence he came out.</hi> ver. 45. <hi>and takes with him ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf, and enter they in and dwell there, and the laſt eſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, They are judicially given up to the power of their ſinful luſts, they <note place="margin">And to the power of their luſts.</note> grow <hi>worſe and worſe;</hi> they having caſt away the cords, and all fear of God there is no wickedneſs but they are ready to obey it, and they do now go on in their daring wayes of bold profaneſs with ſeared conſciences.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They are judiciouſly given up to the powers of damnation; therefore <note place="margin">And to the power of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> it is ſaid that they <hi>draw back unto perdition,</hi> Heb. 10. 39. <hi>And the ſoul of God hath no pleaſure in them,</hi> Ver. 38. O what a dreadful condition is this, to forſake the path of life and heaven, and to turn back to walk in the path of death and Hell!</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They are many times (in their life) given up to exceeding terrors <note place="margin">They are oft given up to terrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</note> of conſcience and deſpair: You may read this in <hi>Judas,</hi> who turned back, and what horror did that poor creature fall into? he forſook his Maſter, and left the path of life for a few pieces of ſilver, but what got he by this! he lept out of the ſhip into the Sea, he could never meet with reſt or peace afterwards, but conſcience brake in pieces, and did ſo purſue him with guilt and terror, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell into abſolute deſpair, and made an end of himſelf: <label type="milestone">

                        </label> The like you read of <hi>Spira,</hi> who revolted from the truth, and the path of Evangelical obedience after clear convictions, and ſecret warnings of Conſcience; but what befell him? O he preſently fell into terror of conſcience and deſpair, and never could recover the leaſt hopes of mercy to his dying day.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They are many times puniſhed by ſome extraordinary judgement here <note place="margin">They are oft puniſhed with extraordinary judgements.</note> on earth: Take an inſtance in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> they gave up to walk any longer in Gods ſtatutes and wayes, they forſook God and his Laws, and what came of this? why, God forſook them, <hi>and gave them up to their own hearts luſts,</hi> and at laſt overthrew them with an <hi>utter deſtruction,</hi> and ſcattered them over the face of the earth. So you read of <hi>Joaſh, who did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord all the dayes of Jehoiada the Prieſt,</hi> 2 Chron. 24. 2. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Ver. 18. <hi>He left the houſe of the Lord and ſerved Groves and Idols;</hi> but what befell him for this? you read of two great judgements that did befall him, one in verſe 24. <hi>That the Syrians came in with a ſmall company of men, and the Lord delivered a great Hoſt into their hand, becauſe they had forſaken the Lord;</hi> ſo they executed judgement againſt <hi>Joaſh:</hi> The other is in ver. 25. <hi>His ſervants conſpired againſt him, and ſlew him.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, Beware of ſlothfulneſs and careleſneſs at any time in doing the will of God, or in walking in his wayes: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Be not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> When a man doth a buſineſs ſlothfully, he doth it with a ſlight ſpirit, he doth not put out himſelf, not his ſtrength, he hath no care in doing of it, he doth it not with a ſerious and diligent ſpirit, but remiſly, and indifferently, as one not affected about what he doth, nor addicted unto it; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>We deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence unto the end.</hi> And Ver. 12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful.</hi> Here he oppoſeth diligence unto ſlothfulneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now there are theſe Reaſons why you ſhould beware of ſlothfulneſs in any act <note place="margin">Reaſons againſt ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Becauſe it is Gods work, and his eye is upon us. Its a work for God.</note> of obedience, or in any work which God commands you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe it is the work of God;</hi> a work that the great God enjoynes you, and in which his eye is upon you; will not the ſervant eye and mind his work when his maſter commands, and his Maſters eye is upon him?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe it is a work for God;</hi> it is to he done not only with a reſpect of congruity as may beſt anſwer his will, but alſo with a reſpect of ſincerity, as may beſt advance his glory; ſhould we be ſlothful, negligent, careleſs, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in any work of ſuch a nature wherein we are imployed of God? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe you do but loſe time;</hi> little or nothing will be done if you be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; <note place="margin">Such do but loſe time.</note> 
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in <hi>Prev.</hi> 18. 9. <hi>He that is ſlothful in his work, is brother to him that is a great waſter:</hi> the great waſter brings a fair eſtate to nothing; ſo a ſlothful perſon brings a good work to nothing; at beſt, your work can never be well done if you do it with a ſlothful heart.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Becauſe in all holy working and walking you ſtill go forward:</hi> Pſal. 24. 3. <note place="margin">In all holy walking there is a going on.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Becauſe you will never be able to held out in walking in Gods ſtatutes,</hi> but will <note place="margin">The ſlothful is prone to Apoſtacy.</note> certainly revolt and apoſtate if you give way to ſlothfulneſs; indeed an accidental ſlothfulneſs may befall the child of God in his way to heaven; but if you give way to a willing and habitual ſlothfulneſs, it is a ſign that your hearts are wicked, that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you are not for God, and cord ally you have no delight in him, or in his wayes, but there is ſome other object which your hearts do more mind and regard.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beware of ſlowneſs in vvalking on in Gods ſtatutes; ſome of you <note place="margin">Beware of ſloth in Gods wayes.</note> need many arguments to avvaken and ſtir up your hearts unto duties; and others do need many Goads to quicken their hearts unto a greater ſpeed and forvvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in duties: The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, that <hi>when for the time they ought to be teachers, yet they had need that one teach th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>of the Oracles of God,</hi> theſe went on very ſlowly. Many Chriſtians are too blame in this, they move on but ſlowly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In points of knowlege, they know but a very little more of the myſteries of <note place="margin">Some move ſlowly in point of knowledg.

                     <p n="2">2. In points of practice; after many years their ſinfull luſts are no more morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and their graces are no more ſtrengthned, and their abilitie (to deny themſelves, and to live by faith, and to ſuffer afflictions, and to be more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profitable in their converſation) is little or nothing raiſed and improved. I would have theſe to conſider,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That this ſlow walking, is very diſproportionable to the means which <note place="margin">Slow walking is very diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the means.</note> God vouchſafes unto them, and to the expectations of God; for <hi>to whom much is given, of them much ſhall be required;</hi> the greater means and helps ſhould be anſwered with the greater fruits and returns.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is very uncomfortable unto your own ſouls; little fruit differs but a little from no fruit: and it is a thouſand to one, but your hearts will be often <note place="margin">Is very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</note> ſhaken and puzzled about the truth of your Spiritual condition, that you never had grace in the truth and power of it, which works ſo weakly and ſo ſlowly, that almoſt all your life long you have got ſo little ground over your ſins, and hardly advanced to one grace more then you had before.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is very unanſwerable to the courſe of humble, and ſolid and ſerious <note place="margin">Its unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſound Chriſtians.</note> Chriſtians; <hi>David made haſte and delayed not.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Nay look on many Chriſtians behind us in time of their calling, ſetting out after us, yet as <hi>Ahimaas</hi> out-went <hi>Cuſhy,</hi> or as <hi>John</hi> out-ran <hi>Peter</hi> to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: ſo theſe of later ſtanding than our ſelves in Chriſt and grace, have left us far behind them, in Knowledg, in Faith, in Love, in Tenderneſs, in Exactneſs, in Zeal, in Fruitfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, Heb.</hi> 12. 12. ſo ſay I unto you, ſtir up the heart, and drive not on ſo heavily, (as if this were the way you had no pleaſure in) but <note place="margin">Motives to make more haſte.

                     <p>Firſt, Are you not in the way to Heaven? O how our ſouls ſhould fly thither! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is reaſon why we ſhould be ſlow unto what is evil, becauſe that leads to Hell: And ſo on the contraty, there is all the reaſon in the world, to be ſtill ſetting forward and foremoſtly walking on in the Statutes of God, for they are the way to Heaven, where all your happineſs and all your treaſure, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or hopes are laid up for ever.</p>

                     <p>How many years did you walk in the vanity of your mindes, and in darkneſs, and in wantonneſs and rioting?

                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, there is a twofold unevenneſs in our walking in Gods ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>One is habitual and general;</hi> and this is when a perſon pretends to walk in <note place="margin">Habitual, and general.</note> Gods ſtatutes, and ſometimes in ſome particular actions doth walk therein, but then, look on this man in the General courſe of his life; and ſo he walks not in the wayes of God, but in the wayes of ungodlineſs; of this man I ſpeak not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Another is particular and actual,</hi> and this is when a perſon is even and right <note place="margin">Particular, and actual.</note> as to the courſe of his walking; but in this or that particular of life he doth ſtep aſide and wander; he breaks out into ſome great tranſgreſſion or other, as you read of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp;c. into leſſer irregularities: this is not a total revolting or Apoſtacy, but it is a particular ſinful deviation and aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which they return again by repentance: Nevertheleſs let all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God beware of all and every particular unevenneſs in their walking; for this is not to proceed and hold on in walking in Gods ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p>There are three things contrary to our going on, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A ſtanding ſtill. <note place="margin">Three things contrary to our going on.</note> 2ly A going over. 3ly A going aſide, though it be but a ſtep into another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary path, yet this one ſtep is oppoſite to going, and it is a hinderance to our going on; we looſe ſo much of our progreſs, as we ſtep aſide from the right path.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is not the leaſt ſin which a man commits, but firſt it is a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">The leaſt ſin puts us out of the way.</note> of the right way; and next it will coſt him ſome time to get out of that wrong way, and to return again into his right way: That one ſinful aberration perhaps may draw and entice him further out of the way, or if it doth not, it muſt coſt him much humiliation of heart, and many tears and prayers to recover and reduce him again.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is a very folly to be at any time uneven in our walking: for either you intend to go on in your error, or to come off from it; if you will go on in your <note place="margin">Its folly to walk unevenly.</note> ſin, you will be damned; if you ſee reaſon to return from it, why did you at all embrace it? Nay the folly appears yet more; for whiles you did ſtedfaſtly walk on in the paths of God, you did unqueſtionably poſſeſs and enjoy peace, and by ſtepping out of thoſe paths, you loſe your peace, and muſt paſs through much bitterneſs before you can poſſeſs that peace of which you by ſinning have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="686" facs="tcp:55323:360" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fourthly, The Chriſtian Traveller hath no ſufficient cauſe to miſplace one ſtep, <note place="margin">We have no cauſe to ſtep aſide.</note> or to ſtep aſide to any unſinful action; and my reaſon is this, becauſe he may find enough in the paths of God: <hi>In my Fathers houſe there is bread enough,</hi> &amp;c. ſtill to ſatisfie him, and much better than in any ſinful or irregular way.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Here he hath protection and ſafety enough; <hi>The Lord himſelf is his guide</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In our way we have protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And pleaſure.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſhield.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Here he hath pleaſure enough, even the joyes of the Holy Ghoſt, unto which the <hi>pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon</hi> are not to be compared.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He hath profit and benefit enough; for in keeping Gods Commandements <hi>there is great reward:</hi> No man gets any things by any ſin, but as God loſeth by <note place="margin">And profit.</note> it much honour, ſo he himſelf loſeth much of his dignity, and of his comfort, and of his ſafety, and of his integrity, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Beware of wearineſs and faintineſs in your walking in Gods ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: There is a twofold wearineſſe as to a walking in the paths of God. <note place="margin">Beware of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs in this way.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. One ariſeth from contrariety of Spirit and diſlike of thoſe wayes: <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Ye ſaid alſo, Behold what a wearineſs is it! and ye have ſnuffed at, it ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Iſa. 43. 22. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob; thou haſt been weary of me O Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another ariſeth from diſpondency of ſpirit, by reaſon of the many diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and troubles befalling us for our walking in Gods ſtatutes, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful keeping of them: As you read of <hi>Elijah</hi> when <hi>Jezebel</hi> threatned to take away his life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 2. the good man hereupon did faint, and was diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and therefore ſaith he, Ver. 4. <hi>It is enough O Lord, take way my life, for I I am not better than my Fathers.</hi> Jer. 20. 8. <hi>The Word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and a deriſon daily.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Then I ſaid I will not make mention of of him, nor ſpeak any more in his name, but his words were in my heart as a burning fire, &amp;c.</hi> Now though this kind of wearineſs be apt to put it ſelf upon us, yet we ſhould put it off by prayer, and by faith: we ſhould not be <hi>weary in well doing;</hi> the Apoſtle preſſeth it twice, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 13. And I will give you four Reaſons why we ſhould not be weary, and faint, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, although we ſee little good of all the pains which we take, and although <note place="margin">Why we ſhould not be weary.</note> we meet with evil for good, reproaches, ſcorns, and croſſes, when we are moſt careful to walk with God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the Lord doth appoint theſe things; he will have them to befall <note place="margin">Becauſe God appoints them.</note> us, to try our love, and faithfulneſs unto himſelf, and true zeal for him, and to exerciſe our faith and patience, and to do us good: If evil men did know how much good the people of God do get by their wicked words and carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, I am perſwaded that they would forbear much more in this kind; little do they think that the people of God (upon theſe occaſions) do more ſearch their hearts and wayes, and do the more humble their ſouls, and are more in prayer, and are more watchful over their wayes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe nothing that you meet with from men can make the leaſt diminution of any true comfort unto you, <hi>e. g.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">They cannot diminiſh our comfort.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It cannot abate one jot of your happineſs: Your happineſs conſiſts in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God to be your God in Chriſt; and this ſun doth ſhine in the midſt of all ſtorms; let men diſgorge themſelves and throw out all the filth they can; <hi>yet God is your God and Father, and loves and owns you,</hi> Rom. 8. 35. to 39.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It cannot hinder any peaceable teſtimony of your conſcience: let mens ſpeeches and cenſures, and dealings be never ſo bitter and baſe, yet you have ſtill the <hi>Teſtimony of conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity you have had your converſation,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. all is well and chearful here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It cannot prejudice any acceptance of your holy walkings or workings with your God at all; God doth not accept of you, becauſe men do approve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you; nor doth God diſreſpect and diſapprove, becauſe men do diſapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and condemn you; but as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake in <hi>Acts</hi> 10 34. <hi>I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons.</hi> ver. 35. <hi>But in every Nation he that fears him and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It cannot deprive you of your reward of well-doing: whatſoever hard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment you may find with men, regard it not, your reward is ſure from the Lord: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 4. <hi>Then ſaid I, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vain, yet ſurely my judgements is with the Lord, and my work with my God.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">They all come from wicked perſons.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe all theſe diſcouragements come only from wicked perſons, and the baſeſt ſort of them, who watch for your halting, and would rejoyce to ſee you turn away from walking with your God; Obſerve and conſider ſeriouſly who they are that ſet themſelves againſt you, and ſtill ſtrive to make your hearts weary, and your hands faint, and would baffle you in your holy walking in Gods ſtatutes; why, they are either Papiſts, or Popiſhly affected, or Hypocrites, or ſome Apoſtates, or a company of Whores, or Whoremongers, or drunkards, or ſwearers; and ſhould your hearts faint for theſe men whom God abhors, and a civil perſon would ſcorn to be a companion unto them? <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> ſaid <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> Chap. 6. 11. <hi>I will be yet more vile,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 22. <note place="margin">They are the common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, Becauſe all theſe diſcouragements are the common lot and portion of all the people of God, yea of Chriſt himſelf: <hi>Therefore ſeeing we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 12. 1. <hi>let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, Preſerve a tender conſcience; a tender conſcience is a ſpring to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, <note place="margin">Four effects of entire love.</note> and a guard unto ſtedfaſtneſs; when a mans conſcience is kept tender, his foot will be kept even: For</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. A tender Conſcience will preſerve Gods favour, and its own peace: O the favour of God, the manifeſtations of his love, the enjoyment of him in kindneſs and peace; theſe are precious hours and dayes unto a perſon of a tender conſcience, he would not willingly part with them, nor forfeit them for all the worlds profit, nor for all the pleaſures of ſin; and therefore he is very ſerious, and very ſtudious to walk in Gods ſtatues alwayes, even to the end, knowing that any voluntary ſwerving, or ſinful wandring will loſe him the joy of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>1. A fear of our ſelves, of our own ſufficiency to maintain our walking: <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 23. This humble fear will make you to be much in Prayer, and be much in a watchful jealouſie over your hearts, and to be much at the Ordinances, and all theſe will make you more conſtant and ſtedfaſt in walking, &amp;c.</p>

A real and cordial walking; we would act in all our duties with our very hearts and ſouls. 2. A conſtant care to walk in all well-pleaſing before him.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Keep up a continual life of faith, and this would carry you on to your journeys end: The Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>we walk by faith, and that we ſtand by</hi>

Hereupon you reſolved (in the ſtrength of Chriſt) to go through thick and thin (come fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or diſhonour, come good report or ill report, come liberty or bondage, come life or death) to cloſe with God and his wayes, to walk in them, to live and die in them: O keep up this reſolution ſtill, faint not at all.

                        </label> Firſt, Be often comparing your wayes or walkings, and Gods word together; your work and your rule together: The Scholler who eyes the copy much, and compares his writing with that, he will much mend his writing thereby: So the Chriſtian, who eyes the word of God much, and compares his daily walking with that rule, he will ſee daily reaſons to reform his heart and mend his walkings. As for the doing of any work, it is the ſafeſt courſe firſt to conſider what warrant we finde in the word of God for the doing of it; ſo when we have done any work, it is beſt to bring the work back to the word of God again, and obſerve wherein we have anſwered the word, commanding and directing of us for the matter and manner of our obedience.</p>
                     <p>O how much weakneſs? How many faylings? How many wandrings ſhall we then finde out? How little of prayer in praying? How little of hearing in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How little of Godly ſorrow in mourning? How little of faith in believing? Enough ſhall we finde ſtill to humble our ſouls; enough ſhall we finde ſtill to provoke us to more integrity, to more affectionateneſs, to more exactneſs and diligence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Often compare your preſent walking with your former progreſſes: So many years a go (I took it) that God called me by his grace, and then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſenſible, and mournful, and diligent, and watchful; ſo and ſo much I got <note place="margin">Compare your preſent walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</note> of Chriſt, and ſo much faith, and ſo much love; ſo and ſo did I put forth my ſelf in the ſeveral wayes and ſervices for Gods glory; ſuch and ſuch delight did I take in himſelf, in his word, in his ordinances, in his people: ſo much power againſt ſuch a ſin, and ſo much victory over the world, and ſo much ſtrength for ſuch a duty. But O my ſoul! what is thy preſent ſtanding? and what is thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent growth? the time is gone much forward, art thou gone more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? It is a griefe to be no more then thou waſt; but it is a ſhame to be leſs then thou waſt. God hath vouchſafed thee more helps to farther thee, more opportunities to advance thee, more mercies to encourage thee, more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to quicken thee, more afflictions to minde thee; and yet, alaſs! thou art ſo far from exceeding thy ſelf, ſo far from out going thy ſelf, ſo far below and behind thy ſelf, that I finde thee more hampered with corrruptions, and more intangled with the world, and more flat in thy affections, and more dull and careleſs in thy ſervices, and leſs circumſpect and fruitful in thy walking.</p>
                     <p>Thy laſt works and walkings are ſo far from being more then thy firſt, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are far leſs then they, Why? Here is leſs ſenſe of ſin; and leſs ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and leſs fear; and leſs deſires after Chriſt; and leſs delight in the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt; and leſs watchfulneſs over thy ſelf; and leſs done for God and for thy ſelf, and for thy family; thou art now more dull, and more dead and weak in grace; longer in time and leſs in growth. O Lord, pardon me, and heal me; awaken and quicken me: I am aſhamed; make me as good, nay make me better then ever I was; O that I could go, that I could run, that I could out run, that I could move faſter, and better (for the time to come) in the wayes of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>3. If you would enjoy liberty indeed, then become the ſervants of God, and walk in his wayes: <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, then are you free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8. 36. Now your ſhackles, and fetters, and priſon doores are broken open: we are freemen in a ſpiritual ſenſe, when we are freed from ſin: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Being then made free from ſin, we became the ſervants of Righteouſneſs:</hi> We are freed from all ſlaviſh fears by reaſon of ſinne; when we receive the free ſpirit of liberty, we become a voluntary people to ſerve the Lord with newneſs of ſpirit, and freeneſs of ſpirit: <hi>Dſal.</hi> 116. 16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, thou haſt looſed my bonds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Object. <hi>But men will diſeſteem us, neglect us, caſt us out of their favour, and</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It is their ſin to do ſo; but it is our duty to walk as God would have us to walk.</p>
                     <p>2. What men will do ſo? none but ungodly men who <hi>speak evil of us, becauſe</hi> 1. <hi>we run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot.</hi> 2. A goodly converſation is a reproach to their ungodly life, and ſhames them.</p>
                     <p>3. Regard not the praiſes of men, but the praiſe of God; this you ſhall be ſure to meet with; he will own you, and honour you, though men do not: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 10. <hi>When my Father and my Mother forſake me, then the Lord ſhall take me up.</hi> The Phariſees reviled and caſt out the blind man cured by Chriſt; but Chriſt met with him, and owned, and ſaved him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 35, 36, &amp;c.</p>

4. You will give a fair account to God that you feared man more than God: Lord, I ſhould have walked in thy wayes, but, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Continuance in ſinful wayes will harden your hearts in them, keep up the love of ſinne, and render the wayes of God more diſtaſtful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And God may in judgement give you up to your own hearts luſts, to walk in the counſels of them, becauſe you do not hearken unto him: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>6. Object. <hi>But I have aſſayed, aad can make no work of it.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, The Lord commands his people to know him, and his wayes: 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Know thou the God of thy Father, &amp;c.</hi> And God doth promiſe to cauſe them to know him: <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 7. <hi>I will give them an heart to know me that I am the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>They ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>3ly The Lord commands his people to fear him: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God and ſerve him.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and walk in his wayes and fear him:</hi> This likewiſe hath God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto his people: <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Lord commands his people to love him: <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God.</hi> Pſal. 31. 23. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints!</hi> and God doth promiſe to give them an heart to love him: <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe the heart, and the heart of thy ſeed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Lord commands his people to mourn for their ſinnes, and to loath their ſins, and to turn from their ſins: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>In that day did the Lord call to weeping, and to mourning.</hi> Jam. 4. 10. <hi>Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord:</hi> And this God doth promiſe to give unto his people: <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one that mourneth for his only ſon, &amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 7. 16. <hi>They ſhall be on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains as the Doves of the valleys, all of them mourning every one for his iniquity.</hi> Pſal. 97. 10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate evil.</hi> Rom. 12. 9. <hi>Abhor that which is evil:</hi> This alſo is promiſed: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 13. <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for your abominations:</hi> Ezek. 18. 30. <hi>Turn your ſelves from your tranſgreſſions.</hi> Hoſe. 14. 1. <hi>Return unto the Lord:</hi> All this is likewiſe promiſed to be given unto the people of God: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Ye ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the covering of thy graven images of ſilver, and the ornaments of thy mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten images of gold, thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi> Jer. 24. 7. <hi>They ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Lord commands his people not to ſuffer ſinne to reign in

them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortal body:</hi> And he promiſeth that ſin ſhall not reign in them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. ver. 14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. Impartially: <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 8. <hi>Thou ſhalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his Commandements.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Affectionately: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 9. <hi>Who are theſe that flee as a cloud, and as the Doves to their windows!</hi> Zech. 8. 21. <hi>The inhabitants of one City ſhall go to another, ſaying, Let us go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hosts; I will go alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Uprightly: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. <hi>I will cauſe them to walk by the Rivers of water, in a ſtrait way, wherein they ſhall not ſtumble; for I am a Father to Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 61. 8. <hi>I will direct their work in truth.</hi> Zech. 8. 3. <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be called a city of truth.</hi> Iſa. 30. 21. <hi>Their ear ſhall hear a word behind them, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  </p>
                  <p>2ly The parallels 'twixt Gods promiſes, and experimental inſtances, <note place="margin">Parallels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gods promiſes, and the Saints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences.</note> wherein you may find that God hath enabled his people there to walk as he hath promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He hath enabled them to know him: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>After that you have known God, or rather are known of God.</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 20. <hi>He hath given us an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that we may know him that is true.</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 21. <hi>I have not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto you, becauſe ye know not the truth, but becauſe ye know it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are enabled to truſt upon him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name will truſt upon thee.</hi> Pſal. 18. 2. <hi>The Lord is my Rock, and my Fortreſs, and my Deliverer, my God and my Strength, in whom I will truſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are enabled to fear him: <hi>I fear God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 42. 18. <hi>One that feareth God,</hi> ſaid God of <hi>Job,</hi> Job 1. 1. <hi>They that feared the Lord ſpake one to another,</hi> Mal. 3. 16. <hi>I fear the Lord thy God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jonah,</hi> Chap. 1. 9. <hi>The Churches walked in the fear of the Lord,</hi> Act. 9. 31.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are enabled to love the Lord; ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116. 1. <hi>I love the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>I will love thee, O Lord my ſtrength!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, And they are enabled to pray unto him, and to call upon him: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Hezekiah, Daniel, Paul;</hi> and to mourn for their ſins; <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> and to hate ſin, <hi>David, Paul,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. <hi>I hate every falſe way;</hi> and to forſake ſin, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 14. 8.

                  <p>Seventhly, And ſo for all the reſt of the Particulars, you have clear inſtances that the people of God have been enabled to walk willingly, conſtantly, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, uprightly, and ſtedfaſtly in his waies.</p>

3ly. The ſeveral wayes how God doth cauſe or enable his people to walk in his Statutes, and to do them.</p>
                  <p>He doth cauſe them to walk in his Statutes, <note place="margin">How God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to walk in his ſtatutes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, By giving unto them his Spirit, who doth</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Change their hearts, and infuſeth into them all Holy and Heavenly Graces, which are ſo many inward principles enabling them to acts or works of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as our ſinfull and corrupt principles make us willing and ready to walk in the wayes of ſin; ſo holy and ſpiritual principles do make us willing and ready to walk in paths of righteouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, By giving faith unto them, and enabling of them to live by faith in all their particular walkings and workings: Beloved, there is a living by faith for mercy, and there is a living by faith for duty.</p>
                  <p>A man lives by faith for duty when he goes out of himſelf, as inſufficient to afford him ſtrength to perform it, and applies himſelf unto, and relies upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the promiſe to give him the ability, becauſe this and that duty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Unto the Promiſe of God, wherein God hath graciouſly engaged himſelf to be an alſufficiency unto his people, and to be their ſtrength, and to ſtrengthen them, and to work all their works in them and for them: Hereupon the weak Chriſtian goes to God when he is to perform any work of obedience, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon him by faith; my God will help me, I have his promiſe to ſubdue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and I have his promiſe to cauſe me to walk in his Statutes and to do them. Lord! faithful art thou who haſt promiſed, and thou art able and willing to perform whatſoever thou haſt promiſed: I have no might nor power to do this which thou commandeſt, but in the Lord there is righteouſneſs and ſtrength. O Lord, remember thy promiſe, <hi>Remember thy word upon which thou hast cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy ſervant to hope:</hi> Be thou the help and ſtrength of my ſoul; work in me <hi>to will and to do of thy good pleaſure. Pſal.</hi> 119. Upon this the Lord hears, and anſwers his ſervants, and fulfills their deſires, and becomes their ſtrength and alſufficiency.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By meeting them in their way and work with ſpecial Evidences and Teſtimonies, and fruits of Love and Peace, and Acceptance and Joy. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 3. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy wayes.</hi> 56. 7. <hi>I will make them joyful in my houſe of prayer; their burnt offerings and ſacrifices ſhall be accepted upon mine altar.</hi> Joh. 14. 21. <hi>He</hi>
                     <pb n="704" facs="tcp:55323:369"/>
                     <hi>that hath my commandements and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi> Now when the travailer in the wayes of Gods Statutes, meets with theſe ſweet fruits, and taſts, and manifeſtations of love, and peace, and joy, they do make a ſtrong impreſſion upon his heart; they do contribute a ſpeciall ſtrength unto him to walk on in thoſe good wayes. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> Pſal. 116. 2. <hi>Becauſe he hath enclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By holding out unto them, and aſſuring them of the great reward of happineſs for all who do walk on in his Statutes.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, three things are certainly true.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a Reward for the righteous; God will render eternal life to them that continue patient in wel-doing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is lawful for the Chriſtian travailer to look at the great Reward: <hi>Moſes</hi> had reſpect unto <hi>the recompence of reward. Heb.</hi> 11. 26. What God doth promiſe freely to give unto his people, upon that they may lawfully look.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That great Reward propounded, and promiſed, and aſſured, hath an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their hearts, it doth work ſtrongly upon their heart that they faint not, that they <hi>give all diligence unto the end,</hi> that they take heed unto their wayes, that they keep on in the path of life; it makes them to run and to ſtrive that they may obtain an <hi>incorruptible crown.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25, 26. and that <hi>eternal weight of glory.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, By Revealing his Arme in his Ordinances, and bleſſing them with Power and Strength unto his people; <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the Ordinances, ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, in whoſe heart are the wayes of them.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You finde many Attributes given to the Ordinances of God, they teach and direct us, they enlighten and convert us, they uphold and ſtrengthen us, they quicken and comfort us, they animate and encourage us, they raiſe and revive us, they edifie and build us up; all theſe effects they do produce, when the Lord is pleaſed to accompany them with his preſence and bleſſings: And experimentally we finde them unto our ſouls; God teacheth us by his word, heales us by his word, helps us by his word, revives, and quickens, and enlargeth, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us by his word; we walk in the light of it, and run in the ſtrength of it, and conquer in the power of it, and renew our might in the comfort of it, and hold up by the promiſes of it; and are ſtill more and more able to do the work of God, by the ſeveral influences from the word of God: The ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God do weaken our corruptions, and ſtrengthen our graces, and comfort our conſciences, and bear down all diſcouragements and oppoſitions; they do enable faith in God, and inflame love to God, and preſerve fear of God, and kindle zeal for God, and increaſe our delight in God; and all theſe do cauſe us to walk in the Statutes of God, and ſtill to do them.</p>
                  <p>4ly. How far forth God doth (in his promiſes) engage the ſtrength <note place="margin">How far God engages him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to keep his people to walk in his wayes.</note> of his grace, and help to cauſe his people to walk in his Statutes and do them.</p>
                  <p>To this I thus anſwer; When God doth promiſe to cauſe his people to walk in his Statutes, and to do them, he doth thus far engage himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew them his wayes, and to teach them what they are to do, and how they are to walk. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Many people ſhall go and ſay, Come ye and let us go up to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his wayes.</hi> Pſal. 25. 8. <hi>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will he teach ſinners in their wayes.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>The meek will he guid in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.</hi> 32. 8. <hi>I will inſtruct the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and teach thee in the way that thou ſhalt go, I will guid thee with mine eye.</hi> Eſa. 30. 21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way walk, ye in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="705" facs="tcp:55323:369"/>
Nay he teaches in particular what they are to do. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation hath appeared to all men.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>Teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, and he teaches them not only as to the matter, but alſo as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their walkings. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Walk as children of light.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay yet more particularly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walk in Love. Ephe.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walk in Wiſdome. Coloſ.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walk Circumſpectly. Ephe.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walk Humbly with thy God. Micah</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walk in the Spirit. Gal.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walk according to the Rule. Gal.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo to walk even as he walked.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To bring or enter them into his wayes: The Lord doth promiſe not only to take them off from their old ſinfull wayes, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>They ſhall not walk an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> more after the imaginations of their evill heart)</hi> but alſo to walk and to know, and approve this way to walk in. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 8. <hi>Cauſe me to know the way wherein I ſhould walk.</hi> 85. 13. <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhall go before him, and ſhall ſet us in the wayes of his ſteps.</hi> 119. 30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth, thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have I laid before me.</hi> Ver. 59. <hi>I thought upon my wayes, and turned my feet unto by Teſtimonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To enable them (as for the whole courſe of their life) to hold on walking in his wayes or Statutes. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 7. <hi>The way of the juſt is uprightneſs. Pſal.</hi> 119. 102. <hi>I have not departed from thy judgments, for thou haſt taught me.</hi> Ver. 112. <hi>I have inclined my heart to perform thy Statutes alway unto the end. Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts that they ſtall not depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He thus far alſo engageth himſelf that if at any time they fall, he will raiſe them up, and if they wander into by-paths, he will bring them back into the right way. <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 119. 176. <hi>I have gone astray like a lost ſheep, ſeek thy ſervant.)</hi> Jer. 3. 22. <hi>Returne ye back-ſliding children and I will heal your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> Ezek. 34. 16. <hi>I will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring again that which was driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and will binde up that which was broken, and will ſtrengthen that which was ſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He will eſtabliſh them unto the end, in their walking in his Statutes. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>comfort your hearts, and eſtabliſh you in every good word and work,</hi> 3. 3. <hi>The Lord is faithful who ſhall eſtabliſh you, and keep you from evil.</hi> 2 Tit. 4. 18. <hi>The Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me unto his heavenly kingdom.</hi> Prov. 2. 8. <hi>The Lord preſerveth the way of his ſaints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5ly. Why God makes his promiſe to cauſe his people to to walk in his <note place="margin">Why God promiſes to make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to walk in his Statutes.</note> Statutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are (of themſelves) inſufficient and unable to do any thing that is good. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> John 15. 5. <hi>I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Jer. 10. 23. <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf; it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe if God leaves them unto themſelves, tbey are not only
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:55323:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unable to walk in his Statutes, but will certainly wander from the way of his Statutes. When God left <hi>David</hi> to himſelf, how wofully did he treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? When God left <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to himſelf, preſently his heart was lifted up with pride: When <hi>Peter</hi> was left unto himſelf, how fearfully did he deny his Maſter?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To ſhew the difference twixt the Covenant of works and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; that is the <hi>miniſtry of the Letter,</hi> and this is <hi>the miniſtry of the Spirit.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>That Covenant of works is a Commanding Covenant, but it is not an Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">How the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works and of Grace differ.</note> Covenant; the Covenant of Grace is a helping Covenant, as well as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Covenant: God herein doth ſhew us what we are to do, and likewiſe inables us to do.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe God will have all the glory of all good to be aſcribed unto himſelf; therefore will he be the cauſe of all good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. <hi>Of him, and through him, are all things; to him be glory for ever.</hi> If we could walk or work by our own ſtrength with out God, then we might boaſt in our ſelves, but God will have no fleſh to boaſt and glory in it ſelf. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou haste not received it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, To comfort and encourage his poor and weak ſervants, under the breadth, and depth, and length of their obedience: When they conſider how much God requires at their hands, and for how long a time, even all the dayes of their life; and then conſider their own weakneſs, alas ſay they, <hi>who is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for theſe things?</hi> How ſhall we be able to perform all thoſe ſervices which God requires?</p>
                  <p>But then when they finde that God (the mighty God) is with them, and he engages himſelf to be their ſtrength and help, and that his grace ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and he will put forth his own hand to their works, this raiſeth and encourageth their hearts; why! I ſhall have Gods help to do all Gods work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, To draw up their hearts unto himſelf, and to ſet their faith a work upon him when they are to do any duty: O ſirs, we ſhould end all our ſervices in a promiſe of acceptance, and begin all our work in a promiſe of aſſiſtance; we ſhould end with glory to God, and begin with the grace of God. God hath promiſed <hi>to cauſe us to walk in his Statutes, and to do them.</hi> And why hath he made this promiſe? but becauſe you ſhould look up to your God by faith, and rely on him for ſufficiency of grace and ſtrength, to carry you out to his Name and power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <head>SECT. I.</head>
                     <p>1 <hi>Uſe.</hi> DOth God promiſe to cauſe his people to walk in his Statutes and to do them? hence we may be informed of ſeveral things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That then without all queſtion, the natural and unregenerate man hath <note place="margin">A natural man can of himſelf do no good.</note> no ſufficiency in himſelf to do any ſpiritual good: For if the people of God (who are called by grace, and are made alive by grace,) are not ſufficient of themſelves, but do ſtand in need of the grace of God to cauſe them to walk in Gods Statutes; much more inſufficient is every natural man to the doing of good, who is <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Hear what the ſcriptures ſpeak of the natural man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe</hi>
                        <pb n="707" facs="tcp:55323:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Jer. 4. 22. <hi>Tbey are ſottiſh children, and they have no underſtanding; they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Hoſe. 8. 12. <hi>I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted a ſtrange thing.</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God; they are corrupt, thy have done abominable works, there is none that doth good.</hi> Prov. 13. 19. <hi>It is abomination to fooles to depart from evil.</hi> Levit. 26. 43. <hi>Becauſe they deſpiſed my judgments, and becauſe their ſoul abhorred my Statutes.</hi> Jer. 13. 23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Tit. 1. 16. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominable, and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all theſe places it doth appear, that there is no power and ſufficiency in any natural man to any ſpiritual good, but a total want thereof, and a total oppoſition unto it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That then God is no hard, cruel, or rigorous maſter unto his ſervants, but very kinde and gracious; we have no reaſon to complain at all, but rather to bleſs him, and cheerfully to ſerve him.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeven things which do reſpect the people of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Enterance, which takes in, 1. Union: <hi>Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. 2. Regeneration. 3. Repentance: This God works in them of his own grace. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Of his own good will begat he us with the word of truth.</hi> Phil. 1. 29. <hi>Unto you it is given to believe.</hi> Acts 11. 18. <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Performances; this likewiſe doth God work in his people. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you, to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Acceptance.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Recompence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Then you ſee the ſame reaſon why, when the ſame truths of God <note place="margin">Why ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth, and others do not. Why not all. God leaves ſome to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not others. They which walk not in Gods wayes, are none of his.</note> are preached, and the ſame wayes of life are revealed, ſome do receive thoſe truths, but others do not; and ſome do walk in thoſe wayes, and ſome do not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt. Why do they not all do ſo?</hi> The Reaſon is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Becauſe God leaves ſome unto themſelves, and others he doth not leave unto themſelves; they do both of them hear the way to heaven, but they have not both the ſame grace and ſtrength given to walk in the way to heaven.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Then they are none of Gods people, who never found any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, any ability, any actual ſtrength to walk in the wayes which God hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: why ſo? becauſe God promiſeth to cauſe his people to walk in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and to do them. I grant that all the people of God do not walk alike in his Statutes; ſome are more lively, ſome are more forward, ſome are more high, and full, and vigorous, and exact then others are; nevertheleſs every one of them hath obtained grace and ſtrength in his proportion to walk in Gods Statutes; every one of them doth pray, and every one of them doth repent, and every one of them doth believe, doth walk in newneſs of obedience, and every one of them doth fear the Lord, and makes conſcience of his wayes, and ſtrives after perfection.</p>

                        </label> You ſee that the leaſt finger in the body receives an influence from the head by which it moves, and ſtirs, and performs the office of its place: And ſo doth the meaneſt and weakeſt ſervant of Chriſt, receive a virtue and power from Chriſt to act, and walk in his proportion: Therefore thoſe men who ſtill continue in their wayes, and have no power to leave them, and who are ſtill charged to walk in Gods wayes, and have no heart nor power to obey him, (no power or ability at all to bewaile their ſins, to forſake their ſins, to poure out their hearts in prayer, to long after Chriſt, to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to prize and hold communion with God;) theſe perſons are not as yet the people of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. There is nothing in the world to evidence it to their ſouls that they are ſo; nothing in practice; for they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eglect all holy walking with God; and nothing in their natures and hearts, for if they were renewed and changed by grace, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there would be an ability, an inclination, a deſire, an endeavour to walk with God according to his word.</p>
                     <p>Take it for a certain truth, that all perſons actually in Covenant with God, have a power given them (more or leſs) to walk as God would have them walk, and to do what God would have them to do; therefore conſider your ſelves and your conditions, all of you who are ſtill without ſtrength to walk; aſſuredly you are without life to quicken: all the children of God are alive, and are thus far enabled by his grace to chuſe his way, and to walk in his way with upright hearts.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Then the wayes of God are poſſible and paſſable wayes; why ſo? <note place="margin">Gods wayes are poſſible and paſſable.</note> becauſe the promiſe of God is annexed unto them.</p>
                     <p>There are two errors oppoſite unto this truth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. One is of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who make the wayes of God concerning us ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, <note place="margin">Papiſts confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> that a man may perfectly fulfil the Law of God; nay as if this were a poor buſineſs, they teach that a man may do yet more then God requires, he may do works of ſupererogation, by which he may merit for himſelf and for his friends; this is a proud and falſe doctrine; for no man (except Chriſt) ever did or could with a legal exactneſs fulfil the will of God: <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 2. And <hi>what man is he that liveth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not?</hi> there is no man that ſinneth not. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 46. And who can ſay <hi>My heart is clean,</hi> or I have made my heart clean, <hi>I am pure from my ſin? Prov.</hi> 20. 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other is of carnal and lazy <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who when they are preſſed to <note place="margin">Carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> leave their ſinful wayes, and to walk in the wayes of Gods Commandements, and to hold on in their walking all their dayes: O ſay they, this is impoſſible, and who can walk thus? But what Chriſt ſpake to another purpoſe, may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied here, <hi>That which is impoſſible with men, is poſſible with God;</hi> or what <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> replied about the work of turning the heart from ſin, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, <hi>Tu non potes, ſed Dominus tuus potest,</hi> thou canſt not turn thy heart, but yet the Lord can turn thy heart: that I ſay in this caſe, It is impoſſible for any man by his own ſtrength to walk in all Gods Statutes, nevertheleſs it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſo to do with Gods ſtrength: <hi>I can do all through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul. Phil.</hi> 4. 13. And <hi>Take my yoak upon you,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>for my yoak is eaſie, and my burthen is light,</hi> ver. 30. How comes it to be eaſie and light? ſurely becauſe you have Chriſt help, as well as Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And thus it is with all the wayes of God; they are poſſible, and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; why ſo? becauſe you have Gods Promiſe, as well as Gods Command. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if they were wayes under a command, then there were no poſſible walking in them, becauſe then the acting of obedience unto them, would reſt upon our own ſtrength, which is none at all; but being wayes alſo under a promiſe of God. who ſaith that <hi>he will cauſe us to walk in them,</hi> now they are poſſible: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, what God promiſeth to do for us, that reſts not upon our ſtrength,
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:55323:371" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but his ſtrength to make us to do, and he is able to make all ſtrength to abound and increaſe within us.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Then it is nothing elſe but a fooliſh and proud conceit in men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay <note place="margin">Of ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer walking in Gods wayes.</note> and defer works of obedience until they 1. Have compaſſed ſo much of the world. 2. Come to be old. 3. Come to be ſick; then they will conſider their wayes, and then they will humble their hearts, and then they will repent, and then they will lay hold on Chriſt, and then they will lead new lives, and then they will make their peace with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not knowing that it is God only who cauſeth us to walk in his Statutes, and to do them; and not knowing that we are not of our ſelves ſufficient to think any thing; and not knowing that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power muſt be the foundation and cauſe of all ſupernatural works; and not knowing that God juſtly may, and often times doth deny his grace and help to them who have refuſed it, and doth leave the refuſing ſinner (forever) to his own luſts and wayes.</p>

This may ſerve for caution unto all the people of God, (eſpecially unto ſtrong Chriſtians) that they take heed of all ſelf-confidence.

                     </list>
                     <p>Now hear my advice; When you are to do any work for God, beware that you reſt not on any of theſe ſelf ſtrengths. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> So ſay I, let not the prudent Chriſtian reſt on his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and let not the knowing Chriſtian reſt upon his parts, and let not the renewed Chriſtian reſt upon his graces, and let not the forward Chriſtian reſt on his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and let not the experienced Chriſtian reſt on his comforts, as if thoſe were able and enough to furniſh and enable him to do the work or works which God requires of him.</p>
                     <p>There are three Reaſons why I would ſeriouſly preſs this caution upon you that fear God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The exceeding aptneſs and propenſion in the beſt, to be and to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">All are proue to truſt too much in ſelf.</note> of themſelves; there is ſcarce any thing concerns us, but ſelf is inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and juſtles in it ſelf; and we are hardly taken off from it, until by woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience we finde much miſchief and miſery in it. Take us in any ſpiritual work, why ſomething of ſelf is appearing; in repentance, men will not forſake their own ſtrength; in the work of faith, men will undertake to believe by their own ſtrength; in the work of juſtification, men are apt to look upon their own righteouſneſs; in active duties, men are many times of their minde in <hi>Jeremiah, The Lord be a faithful witneſs between us, if we do not according to all things which the Lord thy God ſhall ſend thee to us. Jer.</hi> 42. 5. And in paſſive duties, there
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:55323:372" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo we preſume many times too much upon our own ſelf ſtrength; Lord (ſaid <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) I am ready to go with thee, both into priſon and to death. Luk.</hi> 22. 33. And <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all ſhall be offended, yet will not I,</hi> Mar. 14. 29.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The exceeding greatneſs of this ſin: ſelf-confidence, or a truſting <note place="margin">Truſting in ſelf is a great ſin.</note> and relying upon our own ſtrength and ſufficiency, it is a very great ſin; which thus appears.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the pride and unbeliefe in departing from God: that man who makes not God his whole confidence, departs from him. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide of heart, and (which is worſe) the ſpiritual pride of heart, which God abhors, and is utterly contrary unto; but humility of heart is that which God doth much value and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a kind of Atheiſm: the creature which would be a ſelf-ſufficiency unto it ſelf, denies God in his Al-ſufficiency; it is proper to God as God to be a being of himſelf, and to give being unto all beſides himſelf; to be independing on any for being and working.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. At leaſt you take the work of God out of the hand of God; his work it is to make us good, by his preventing grace; and his work it is to enable us to good, by his ſubſequent grace; and yet you will undertake by your own ſtrength and by your own arme to conquer ſins, to reſiſt temptations, to perform acts of obedience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. You take the courſe to ſet up your ſelves, and to lay aſide your God; to magnify your ſelves, and to nullify him; to glory in your ſelves, and to take glory from God; if you will be the efficient cauſes of doing good without God, you will make your ſelves the final cauſe of good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The exceeding great danger of ſelf-confidence to do any good: and <note place="margin">The danger of ſelf-confidence.</note> there are three dangers which will befal you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You will be but poor and barren, and inſufficient, ſo as to do nothing at all: as the ſhip lies ſtill if the winde ſtirs not; <hi>(without me you can do nothing)</hi> you will be weaker then the weakeſt Chriſtian; the weakeſt Chriſtian truſting on Chriſt, and the promiſe, will be able to do much, when you relying on your ſelf-ability, will be able to do nothing.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of being. <note place="margin">Two ſorts of being.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>One is abſolute and of it ſelf, as God is who is of himſelf, and can work alone by and from himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Another is depending; ſuch a being is every creature, yea and every created grace, which as it is by virtue of Gods grace, ſo it acts in virtue of his aſſiſtance: As a beam of the ſun is made alive by the ſun, and it gives light by the continued influence of the ſun: part it and the ſun; it is nothing ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 God will leave you (at leaſt a while) unto your ſelves, that you may be aſhamed of your confidence, and ſee your ſelves to be but vanity, that you are indeed without ſtrength, and utterly inſufficient of your ſelves; and that you ſtand only, and work only in the preſence of his might.</p>
                     <p>You read that God hath left his ſervants in four caſes. <note place="margin">In what caſes God leaves his ſervants.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>One when they have been idle and careleſs, and venturing upon the occaſions of ſin; this was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe:</p>
                     <p>A ſecond, when they have not ſtedfaſtly believed his word, but have given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to Satan; upon this he left <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> unto themſelves.</p>
                     <p>A third, when they have ventured upon evil company; in this caſe he left <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A fourth when they have preſumed upon their own ſtrength and ſufficiency; and in this he left <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. And now you will not be able to do any good, nay not able to withſtand the greateſt ſins; Satan will be too hard for you, and ſo will ſin; we ſhall quickly hear you complaining of hardneſs of heart, and of deadneſs of heart, and of
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:55323:372" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unbelief of heart; and I wiſh theſe were the worſt. God doth ſome times cure the proud ſelf-confidence, and the proud ſelf-ſufficiencies of his people, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſome groſs and vile falls, as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is indeed no ſelf-ſufficiency in you, although ſometimes <note place="margin">Wherein our weakneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</note> you veryly imagine and fancy it; and I would convince you of this by your own experience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You cannot pull down any one ſin that troubles you by your own ſtrength, it will move, and ſtrive, and tempt, and follow you; and do what you can, (by all your own ſtrength) it doth many times captivate you.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You cannot riſe out of any ſinful fall, unleſs the Lord gives you his hand to lift you up; there your feet ſtick in the mire, and every grace that you have is nonpluſſed; repentance will not ſtir, and ſorrow will not melt, and faith will not take hold, unleſs the Lord himſelf comes in with new ſtrength and aſſiſtance, you cannot deliver your ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You cannot (many times) act any one grace when your deſires are ſo to do; you finde your hearts many times hard, but you cannot ſoften them; dull, and you cannot quicken them; ſtraitened, and you cannot enlarge them; you would mourn, but cannot fetch up your tears? you would believe, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtretch forth one act of faith; all that comes from you, is, <hi>Lord help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe;</hi> you would pray, but are not able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

When you are to do any work or dutie, (ſuppoſe it be to repent, to believe, to pray, to preach, to withſtand a temptation, to caſt out a ſinful corruption) preſerve in your hearts a ſenſe of your own weakneſs and inſufficiencie; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, ſo do you, Lord, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.

                     <p n="2">2. Such as are ſeldom in prayer, when they are to do any work commanded them of God; theſe men do not ſee their own weakneſs and inſufficiency; they do imagine that they are able to carry on their work in their own ſtrength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtrength of God; elſe they would be much in prayer to God for his help, and for his aſſiſtance.</p>

                     <p>1. Unto thoſe that are ſenſible of their ſins; <hi>He bindes up the broken</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, Not to deſpond or caſt down their hearts by reaſon of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or by reaſon of the multiplicity, and by reaſon of the difficulty of the works and duties which God requires from them; depth, and breadth, and length of mens obedience are nothing, as long as there is depth, and breadth, and length o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Gods aſſiſtance. I confeſs that theſe would be ſtrong diſcouragements, were we to traverſe the wayes and works of God by our ſtrength; but they ſhould not make any diſcouraging impreſſion, ſeeing our hands ſhall be made ſtrong by the Almighty arm of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Is any thing too hard for the Lord!</hi> (he is able <hi>to do exceeding abundantly above all that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Never ſay, If I were ſo ſtrong as ſuch or ſuch a one, then I could do much, but I am weak. I tell you that the ſtrong Chriſtian without the help of God, is but weak; and the weak Chriſtian with the help of his God is ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>But to remove all diſpondency of heart from weak Chriſtians about their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <note place="margin">What weak Chriſtians ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</note> and great, and continual works of obedience, I would deſire them carefully to remember and lay up four ſingular Adjuncts or ingredients in that helping and aſſiſting grace which God do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h promiſe unto them.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Coextention as to all the parts and times of duty.</item>
                        <item>2. Sufficiency as to enabling for theſe duties.</item>
                        <item>3. Redundancy or exuberancy; there is help enough and to ſpare.</item>
                        <item>4. Infallibility or certainty of enjoying that aſſiſting grace, if they look up to God for it.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, Coextention: The helping or aſſiſting grace of God promiſed unto his people, is not limited or reſtrained to this or that particular duty, not to this or that particular time of life; but it extends to all our work, and for all the dayes of our life.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It extends to all the duties which God requires of us; what the Apoſtle <note place="margin">Aſſiſting grace extends to all our works, and at all times.</note> ſpake in another caſe: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt;</hi> That may be ſaid in this caſe, As our duties and ſervices abound, ſo the help and ſtrength of Gods aſſiſting grace abounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
                     <p>Our duties are ſometimes ſummed up. 1. Into the love of God. And 2ly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the love of our neighbour; and the promiſe of aſſiſting grace extends to both theſe: For the one, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>I will circumciſe, &amp;c.</hi> For the other, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our duties are ſometimes ſummed up into 1. Affirmative. 2ly Negative; the one is of the good which we are to do; the other is of the evil which we are to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake; and you have the promiſe of aſſiſting grace as to both of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For theſe, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>They ſhall come thither, and they ſhall take away all the deteſtable things thereof, and all the abominations thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our duties are ſometimes ſummed up, 1. Into active. And 2ly into paſſive; both theſe have aſſiſting grace promiſed; for the firſt, <hi>Ye ſhall keep my judgements and do them:</hi> For the ſecond, <hi>it is given unto you on the behalf of Chriſt to ſuffer for his Name,</hi> Phil. 1. 39.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It extends unto our duties for all the dayes of our life; aſſiſting grace is promiſed to come in as duties are to go on: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 31. <hi>They ſhall renew their ſtrength.</hi> Chap. 41. 1. <hi>Let the people renew their ſtrength.</hi> Chap. 46. 3. <hi>Hearken unto me O houſe of Jacob, and all the remnant of the houſe of Iſrael, which are born by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>And even to the old age I am he, and even to hoary hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear, even I wiill carry, and will deliver you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sufficiency: There is a ſufficiency in that aſſiſting grace promiſed to enable the people of God effectually for the greateſt and hardeſt duties; which I ſhall clear by a few inſtances.</p>
                     <p>Said God to <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen. 22. 2.) <hi>Take thy ſonne, thine only ſonne Iſaac</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">There is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace.</note> 
                        <hi>whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the Land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt burnt-offering, &amp;c.</hi> Was not this a very hard and difficult work to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? againſt which all the ſtrength of nature might riſe, yea and grace itſelf might have diſputed the lawfulneſs of it; nevertheleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> was enabled to obey this command, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
                     <p>Again, is it not a great work for a perſon to leave all that he hath, and then to
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:55323:374" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſubmit himſelf unto a ſuffering condition? Yet the people of God have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled unto this: <hi>Moſes</hi> left all his honor, and riches, and pleaſure, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God. Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26. And ſo did the Diſciples; they forſook all and took up the croſs, and followed Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Again, is it not a great and difficult work, for any man to paſs through all changes (incident to our conditions) with a compoſed, quiet and wel-pleaſed ſpirit? Yet <hi>Paul</hi> was enabled to do this; to come up unto it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things, I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound and to ſuffer need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Once more, when we are reduced to the extreameſt of outward ſtraits, that no viſible mercie on earth appears for us, is it not then a very hard work to look up to God, and to place our confidence upon him? Yet <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was enabled in this caſe ſo to do. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>We have no might,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee:</hi> Nay when the Lord himſelf withdraws and hides his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce, and writes and ſpeaks bitter things, it is now a moſt difficult work to look up unto him, and to truſt upon him: certainly it is one of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt works in the world for any Chriſtian to do it: Nevertheleſs the people of God have found ſuch a ſufficiencie of Gods aſſiſting grace, that (in ſuch a caſe) they have been enabled to look up unto him, and to truſt upon him. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him. Job</hi> 13. 15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Redundancie: There is not only a ſufficiencie in Gods grace effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">A redundancy of Grace.</note> to enable his ſervants, but there is alſo a redundancie. Whats that? That is, the Lord hath ſtrength more then enough for the works which his people are to perform. When you caſt up all the duties which do concern you, and then think of the greatneſs of that aſſiſtance neceſſarie for the performing of them; and do many times pray for, and finde an aſſiſtance proportionable to your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: why, God is able to communicate much more aſſiſtance and ſtrength, then ever you found or imagined. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>He is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh in us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you need power to truſt on him, he doth give that power, and he can enable you more then only to truſt in him; he can enable you to wait and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him.</p>
                     <p>When you need aſſiſtance to reſiſt a ſin or a temptation, God gives you ſtrength ſo to do, and yet he can give you much more power then that; he can enable you alſo to conquer them, yea and <hi>to be more then conquerers through him that loved you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you need a heart to pray unto him, he can give you that heart to pray; he can help your infirmities; and more can God do than this; he can alſo ſtrengthen you to pray with confidence, and to ſtrive and wreſtle in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to make your hearts joyful in his houſe of prayer.</p>
                     <p>When you need a heart to ſuffer, he can not only give you ſtrength to ſuffer, but enable you to ſuffer more then your adverſaries can inflict.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Certaintie of enjoying that aſſiſting grace, if they do look up to God <note place="margin">Certainty of enjoying Gods aſſiſting grace.</note> for it: Here briefly obſerve two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Gods promiſe of aſſiſting Grace, doth not exclude our calling upon God for the ſame; for even for this, as well as for the reſt of the good things promiſed by God, it holds, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That when we do rightly call upon God for his aſſiſtance, for his grace to cauſe us to walk in his Statutes, the Lord will not deny it unto us, but will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:55323:374" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give it unto us. <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given unto him:</hi> ver. 6. <hi>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 57. 2. <hi>I will cry unto God moſt high, unto God that performeth all things for me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. But clear this by inſtances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol. Pſal.</hi> 138. 3. <hi>In the day when I cried, thou anſweredſt me, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Cleered by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> 
                        <hi>me with ſtrength in my ſoule.</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 8. <hi>For this I beſought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me:</hi> ver. 9. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. O but for all this, I finde many times no help or ſtrength from God, although he ſaith that he will cauſe us to walk in his Statutes, and to do them; and this diſcourages me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I would give theſe anſwers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The imparting of promiſed help, is not by way of neceſſarie or natural dimanation, as the ſun imparts light unto the earth, but by way of voluntary and prudent diſpenſation, as a father imparts ſupplies unto his children; who comes in with his helps in a time of need, and upon the humble addreſſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of his children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. You want more help, but do you call upon the Lord for more help?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> God expects to hear from you, as you deſire to hear from him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12. <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you:</hi> ver. 13. <hi>And ye ſhall ſeek me and finde me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your art.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though you have prayed, yet did you pray in faith? <hi>He that comes to God, muſt beleive that God is; and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>I ſay unto you, what things ſoever ye deſire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi> Mar. 11. 24.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But do you with patience wait upon the Lord? The Prophet ſaith, that <hi>the Lord is a God of judgment; bleſſed are all they that wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> for him.</hi> Eſa. 30. 18. And the Church ſaith, <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation, my God will hear me.</hi> Micah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. 7. And <hi>David</hi> declares it upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he enclined unto me and heard my cry.</hi> Pſal. 40 1.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſay unto you, put theſe three things together in practice, and then you ſhall aſſuredly finde that aſſiſting grace which you need; whether it be for reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of temptations, or for victorie over corruptions, or for abilitie for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. But I would enjoy ſuch a full power of aſſiſting and helping grace at once,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">But I would have full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of aſſiſting grace.</note> 
                        <hi>that I might make a perfect riddance of all ſin, and be alwayes compleatly and preſently furniſhed for any acts of obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Belike you would needs be in the Prodigals condition, to have all your portion of goods in your own hands, thinking that you are more wiſe and more able than your God, to manage the ſtock of grace! But,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is not only fitter, but better that you ſhould truſt God, then that God ſhould truſt you; your grace and ſtrength are ſafer in his hands, than in yours.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God will not thus impart his ſtrength unto you; as you imagine or wiſh; but he will impart it ſuccſſively and gradually, according to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual neceſſities of it.</p>
                     <p>1. He would ſtill keep you humble. 2. He would ſtill keep you in dependance <note place="margin">Why God gives grace gradually.</note> upon himſelf. 3. He would give unto you manifold experiences of his faithfulneſs in performing his promiſe unto you.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To depend on God, and to make him their ſtrength for all the works which they are to perform.</p>

Prov. 3. 5. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>In all thy wayes acknowledg him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> Eſa. 26. 4. <hi>Truſt you in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> God (you ſee) calls on us for our dependance on him, and only upon him, and at all times, in all our occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is his honor that you do depend on him, to help and ſtrengthen <note place="margin">It is for Gods Honour.</note> your ſouls: you do now declare, and publiſh, and put unto your ſeal, that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er belongs to God; that he is the alſufficient and efficient God; and that he is the faithfull God, who will perform whatſoever promiſe he hath made unto you. Unqueſtionably God would have his people to honor him, (he forms them for his praiſe,) and all the honor which God hath by us, conſiſts in this, that he is acknowledged to be the only efficient, and the only end of all that we have or do.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is the end why he makes this promiſe of <hi>cauſing you to walk in his</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, It is his way of conveying or communicating his ſtrength and help: <note place="margin">It is Gods way of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his ſtrength.</note> all your ſights of his mercy, all your taſte of his love, all your experiences of his goodneſs, and all the impartings of his help and ſtrength are unto faith; you muſt <hi>believe, if you will be eſtabliſhed</hi> and ſtrengthened: God will give ſtrength to his promiſe, but then his people muſt come and depend upon him for it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. Indeed if you ſpeak of the abſolute power of God, he can let out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſufficient help for our work without any praying of ours, and without any belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ours.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But God is pleaſed to ſet out this way of depending and believing to let forth his help unto us as the beſt way to his own wiſdome, both for the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own weakneſſes, and for the demonſtration of his own graces and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                     <p>2. None beſides God, can be a ſufficiency unto us, or help unto us.</p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe God makes them to be of help and ſtrength unto you: The conduit conveyes water into your houſes, but water comes not from the Conduit, but from the Spring: Therefore you finde ſometimes Ordinances and Conferences can do nothing at all in any way of help, that you may know, that not they, but God in and by them, was the help.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Prevalency: Dependance on God for ſtrength, will get you his ſtrength; Pſal. 84. 5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee:</hi> ver. 7. <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 28. 7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſhield, my</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> In three Caſes.</p>
                     <p>1. When the works or duties ſeem unto us little, and common, and eaſie, not <note place="margin">In what caſes we are apt to think well of our ſelves.</note> needing any ſingular preſence of Gods Grace: As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thought about the taking of <hi>Ai,</hi> it was but a ſmall City, and a few men would ſerve the turn, and there was no need to trouble all the hoſt: But they found it otherwiſe, &amp;c. ſo when any duty ſeems but ordinary, a ſmall work; and we need not call in for the help of God, it is but to meditate, it is but to pray, it is but to read the Word, but to hear a Sermon, but to reſiſt a temptation, but to deny a very light occaſion of ſinning, but to bear an ordinary Croſs or affliction.</p>
                     <p>Now we are apt to think we can do theſe ordinary works, and we can paſs theſe ordinary croſſes; and are not very importunate with God to aſſiſt and enable us. But what comes of this? why! either we can do nothing at all! or elſe what we do is but ſuperficial and cold; or that little temptation or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſin is too hard for us, and that little Croſs fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> us with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and vexation, and diſcontent, &amp;c. Therefore I beſeech you who are the people of God, Learn to go out of your ſelves. Learn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Gods ſtrength, even for the leaſt Duty that you are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: there is in the leaſt duty (whether Active or Paſſive) enough to exerciſe your Faith; Though the greateſt work be not above Gods ſtrength, yet the leaſt is above your ſtrength. If you can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, then you cannot do the leaſt good work without him. If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were not ſufficient of themſelves to think any thing, much leſs are we able of our ſelves do any thing! Nay, and you may obſerve it, That the failings of the people of God are uſually about ordinary duties: They do carry on their difficult works, better than they do their ordinary works; what is the Reaſon of this? becauſe in them they look up more to God: but in theſe, they look more at themſelves.</p>

Secondly, When we have found more than ordinarie enlargments in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, that our hearts have melted in the confeſſion of our ſins, and that our hearts have wreſtled with God in Prayer, and our reſolutions have been exceedingly ſtrengthened and ſharpned: O now beware of thy ſelf; and now have a ſpecial care to make God alone thy ſtrength: why? becauſe now thou ſhalt (through ſubtiltie of temptation,) be inclined to think too highly of thy ſelf, and of thine own ſtrength; and that this may laſt long; and the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, When we have taſted of the wonderful goodneſs of God in high and rich experiences, nay in the very healings and aſſurances of his own ſpirit, that we have heard the voice of joy, all is pardoned, God is reconciled: Hereupon our hearts ar exceedingly raiſed to God, in bleſſing and praiſing, and ſaying, What ſhall I do for this good God? O but remember to raiſe your hearts in a careful and watchful, depending on Gods ſtrength and ſufficiencie, ſtill to enable you to walk with him, and to do for him: You think you can do much more, and I do verily believe you would do much more; but all thoſe gracious experiences without any aſſiſtance and influence from God, will not be ſufficient unto you</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We ſhould eſpecially depend upon God for his ſtrength and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie then when we do meet with the greateſt ſtrength of oppoſition to the performing of any good work or works: as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, when the people <hi>ſpake of ſtoning him,</hi> he did then encourage <hi>himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.

All which do tend to diſcourage our hearts, and to weaken our hands, and to interrupt or divert our feet from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Gods wayes, and from doing of the works which God requirs of us in our places: Now this is the time to look up to God and to truſt on him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and enable the heart to ſerve him, to hold on in walking before him with all faithfulneſs, wiſdome, zeal and patience: now make uſe of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41. 10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not diſmaid, for I am thy God; I will ſtrengthen thee; yea I will help thee; yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Zech. 4. 6. <hi>This is the w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, We ſhould eſpecially depend on God for ſtrength, when we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to do any work wherein the glory of God, and the good of his Church, and our own ſalvation, are more ſingularly concerned.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Theſe are ſervices and works of the higheſt, and of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: there is no work whatſoever (wherein we can deal) which is or can be of a higher nature, for excellencie neceſſitie, felicitie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Miſcarriages under theſe, would prove very woeful and ruinous: that Gods glory ſhould faile in my hand, or the good and ſafety of the Church in my hand, and my own ſoul ſhould periſh by my own neglect.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And of all works theſe do meet with the greateſt oppoſition, from without our ſelves, and from within our ſelves: the gates of hell are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet for theſe hath God moſt of all engaged his power, and preſence, and ſtrength, as you may ſee in the varietie of his promiſes, and in the glory of his providences; therefore when you are called to do any work, which hath a neer and ſpecial reſpect to theſe things, fall down and pray; look up and depend: as he ſaid, <hi>de deo nil ſine deo;</hi> we can know nothing of God without God: ſo ſay I, <hi>pro deo nil ſine deo;</hi> we can do nothing for God without God; nothing for his glory, without his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>O Lord, the work which I am now endeavouring, thou knoweſt, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thy name and glory; the good and welfare of thy Church, which is the <hi>apple of thine eye,</hi> and the <hi>dearly beloved of thy ſoul;</hi> and it reſpects mine own eternal ſalvation, which thou wouldſt have me <hi>work out with fear and trembling:</hi> good Lord leave me not; hide not thy ſelf, but appear in thy ſtrength for the carrying on of theſe works; come in with thy wiſdom to direct me, and with thy grace to quicken me, and with thy ſpirit to lead, and uphold, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per me.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, When the work is extraordinary and univerſal, of much difficultie and danger, and requires more then ordinarie hight of ſpirit, and courage, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, now is your time not <hi>to conſult with fleſh and blood;</hi> not to conſider your own proportion of gifts and abilities; but by faith to look up to him who commands the work, and promiſeth his aſſiſtance and preſence for the work. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>I will ſend thee unto</hi> Pharoah (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes,) that thou mayſt bring forth my people, the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of</hi> Egypt: ver. 11. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid to God, Who am I that I ſhould go unto</hi> Pharoah? <hi>and that I ſhould bring forth the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of</hi> Egypt?

Beloved, as the weakeſt duties are above our ſtrength; ſo the greateſt and hardeſt are below Gods ſtrength: it is not what you are, but what your God is who commands you, and what he will be unto you, who hath promiſed his own power and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, When neer, great, and ſuddain changes do befall us; as the loſs of a husband, wife, child, parent, friend, eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is a time wherein ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily we are weak, and do ſtand in need of more ſtrength than our own, to bear the hand of God with patient ſubmiſſion, and to make a ſanctified uſe of the ſame.

                     <p>Seventhly, When we have made ſolemn vows in our diſtreſſes of particular reformation, or of better walking with God: O if God will ſpare me, if God will hear me, then this I will be, and thus I will walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed the ſin is great to anſwer for ſuch works, and God will certainly require them at your hands: therefore when God hath anſwered you, O begg for his grace, for his ſtrength to enable you. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>They ſhall make a vow unto the Lord and perform it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eighthly, We ſhould in a ſpecial manner depend upon God for his own ſtrength to be revealed unto us, when we have experimentally found any work or duty ſticking long upon our hands, and we cannot get it forward, and accompliſh it with our ſtrength: as many times a man reſolves to leave ſuch and ſuch a ſin, and is very ſerious in his reſolution, and yet he findes himſelf hampered, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by it.</p>
                     <p>And many times a man reſolves upon ſuch or ſuch a heavenly duty, which is of an excellent nature; and yet he cannot get up his heart unto it, but he ſtill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and neglects it, or is by carnal counſel and pleaſures taken off from it.</p>
                     <p>In theſe and the like caſes, we ſhould go and weep before the Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, both the deceitfulneſs and inſufficiencie of our own hearts; and earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Lord to take 1. our hearts, and 2. our works into his own hands; that he would change our hearts, and that he would direct our ſteps; and that he would mortifie our ſinful luſts, and by his ſtrength tread down ſtrength, that he would lead captivitie captive, that he would break our bonds for us, and ſet us at libertie by the power of his own Spirit.</p>

Beloved, remember this, that the more that any man depends upon himſelf, the leſs he is in prayer to God: (for ſaith he,) I have wiſdom enough; and I have ſtrength enough to do this work; and the more that any man depends upon God, the more will he pray unto God: he that believes moſt, will pray moſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times ye people, poure out your hearts before him; God is a refuge for us.</hi> Becauſe if you do indeed truſt on God; if you do indeed believe that God is your ſtrength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, you will then poure out your heart in prayer before him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 10. <hi>I believe, therefore have I ſpoken.</hi>

Were theſe no might? No, they were not; ſelf-ſufficiencie is no ſufficiencie, and ſelf-might is no might, and therefore he feared him ſelf in the higheſt of his own ſufficiencies; and his eyes are upon God; in and from him was might and ſufficiencie indeed. The like you read in a ſpiritual caſe of <hi>Paul;</hi> as able an Apoſtle, and as laborious, and as powerful as any of them all, and one that relied as much upon the grace of God in Chriſt, and one that had as choiſe and eminent abilities of knowledge and grace; yet ſaith he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves; but our ſufficiencie is of God:</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>who hath made us able miniſters of the new teſtament.</hi>

And ſo indeed it is with every one who knows that God is his ſtrength and ſufficiencie; he is afraid of every thing which may move the Lord to depart from him, and to leave him unto himſelf; he is afraid of every groſſe ſin, and of going againſt the light of the word, and againſt the working of the ſpirit, and againſt the checks and warnings of his own conſcience, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that for theſe things God hath left his people, and hath withdrawn his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aſſiſtance from them, as you may read in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>

Zerubbabel <hi>thou ſhalt become a plain.</hi> Sometimes you meet with dreadful temptations; and if you do believe and relie on Gods ſtrength, you will reſiſt them, and fight againſt them, and expect victory over them; for God is on your ſide, and his ſtrength will bear down all the ſtrength of Satan.

Somtimes you meet with wonderful oppoſitions from the world; why, your God is with you, and for you, and he will uphold and ſtreng then you; and fill you with love and zeal for his name. O when a man believes indeed on God, he doth then 1. Oppoſe ſtrength to ſtrength. 2. See all to be weakneſs which oppſeth God. 3. That Gods ſtrength will carry all before it. 4. That works which heretofore ſeemed impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and unfeaſible, and we did deſpaire ever to compaſs them: now we look upon them as poſſible to be done, and dare to ſet upon them, and are confident to be ſucceſsful in them: ſtrong temptations and corruptions will now appear to be vincible; and the greateſt and hardeſt of holy duties will now appear to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Beloved, there is a marvellous difference between preſumption and faith: preſumption is a very bold, and boiſterous, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular confidence on God, both for pardoning mercy, and for aſſiſting grace: the man loves his ſins and lives in them, and yet doubts not of Gods mercy to pardon his ſins; and the man expoſeth himſelf to the temptations of ſins, and preſumes on Gods help to keep him from ſin: and the man lives in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or in the neglect of Gods ordinances, and preſumes of Gods help and ſtrength for all his works: <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                        </label> Juſt as if a man ſhould voluntarily leap into the ſea, and think that God muſt keep him from drowning; or as if a man ſhould deſire to be ſtrong, and yet refuſe daily food which is a means of ſtrength. Thus it is when perſons are fooliſh and proudly preſumptuous. When we do indeed rely on God by faith for his gracious aſſiſtance, to enable us either againſt the doing of evil or for the doing of good, we do then decline all ſinful occaſions which draw us on to ſin; and we do then apply our ſelves to all thoſe means which God hath ſet apart, and doth bleſs to convey his ſtrength unto us.</p>
                     <p>There are three wayes wherein God reveales, or gives out ſtrength unto us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His word which begets and nouriſhes us; which conveys life unto us, and <note place="margin">Three wayes wherein God gives out ſtrength to us. The Word.

I doubt that ſome of you are in the wayes of weakneſs, and not of ſtrength; not in Gods wayes, but in Satans wayes; not attending the doctrins of truths, but the doctrins of lyes and errors; not keeping cloſe to Gods ordinances, but roving out after ſuch teachers as diſtil into you ſcorns and contempts of Gods Ordinances: Is this to rely on God for ſtrength, when for lying vanities you forſake the paths of God, and of his ſtrength, and of your own true peace?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, What ſhall I ſay more? if you do indeed depend on God as your <note place="margin">We muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on God as our ſtrength.</note> ſtrength to enable you to walk in his ſtatutes, you ſhall then finde a ſpiritual reſt or quietation in your hearts, joyned with a ſpiritual liberty or freedom. You cannot imagine how tumultuous and unſetled a mans heart is, and how ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it is, and backward his heart is unto duties, whilſt he ſtill ſees holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work to be done, and no ſtrength undertaking to enable him for that work; or at leaſt if he cannot believe that God will be his ſtrength: his thoughts are many times confounded and amazed, and his very heart ſometimes quakes
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:55323:379" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and trembles. But on the contrary, when he can by faith ſee the ſufficiencie of Gods ſtrength, and is able to fix and rely himſelf upon it, then theſe two things <note place="margin">Two things follow our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God.</note> will preſently follow and appear.</p>
                     <p>1. One is Quietation: his whole ſoul comes into a calme, and is cleared of all thoſe boyſterous ſtorms of unbelieving fears: my God is my ſtrength: the work is much, but he hath help enough and will not faile me.</p>
                     <p>2. The other is a Liberty and enlargedneſs; he hath now a heart ready and free to ſet upon the work.</p>
                     <p>4. Queſt. <hi>What one muſt be, and do, that ſo he may finde God to be his ſtrength</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How to finde God to be our ſtrength.</note> 
                        <hi>enabling him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are foure things which I would anſwer to this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If you would finde God to be your enabling ſtrength, then there muſt be a relation twixt God and you; he muſt be your God, if you would finde him to be your ſtrength. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 2. <hi>I will ſay of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortreſs, my God, in him will I truſt.</hi> Micah 7. 7. <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation; my God will hear me.</hi> Pſal. 68. 28. <hi>Thy God hath commanded thy ſtrength; ſtrengthen O God that which thou haſt wrought in us.</hi> Beloved, the Lord calls upon us to be his people; to take off our hearts from all other objects, and to give them in unto himſelf, and to exalt him in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity and authority; which if we do, he will be our God, and will perform all the good of his Covenant unto us. Now if any man ſaith, I do not like to ſerve this God; I would rather ſerve my ſins and the world; let not that man think to finde any good from God: neither love, nor mercy, nor grace, nor ſtrength: But if a mans heart doth like and conſent, chuſe the Lord to be his God, and him he loves, and him he will ſerve; he is now come into the bond of the Covenant, and God is bound to finde him mercy to pardon him, and grace to change him, and ſtrength to enable him for all the duties or works which he requires from him: and he may in the ſenſe of his ſufficiency go to God, and truſt on him, and wait on him; and ſhall aſſuredly receive ſtrength and power from his God, to walk in his Statutes and to do them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If you would finde the Lords ſtrength to cauſe you to walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then you muſt get to him in the name of Chriſt; not in your own name or worthineſs or merit, or goodneſs for which the Lord ſhould give out his help unto you, but only in the name of Chriſt; that the Lord for his ſake would make his promiſe good unto you; for all the <hi>promiſes of God are yea and amen in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. And Chriſt hath aſſured you, that <hi>whatſoever you ſhall aske the father in his name, he will give it you,</hi> Joh. 16. 23. I am weak, Lord, ſtrengthen me for Chriſts ſake: I am inſufficient, without ſtrength, able of my ſelf to do nothing, O Lord help me, O Lord, <hi>work all thy works</hi> in me for Chriſts ſake; for Chriſts ſake pull down my ſins, for Chriſts ſake enable me to walk in all well-pleaſing before thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you would finde the ſtrength of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then you muſt be ſure to keep your hearts upright with God, that it is indeed your ſouls deſire, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to walk in Gods wayes, and to do his work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object. A man many times complaines that he can get no power from God againſt his ſins, and no power to do ſuch and ſuch duties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I will tell you the reaſon of it; becauſe his heart ſecretly loves ſuch a ſin, and is not willing to be parted from it; and his heart ſecretly diſlikes ſuch a way of God, and therefore the Lord gives him no power or ſtrength, and regards not his prayers, nor his complaints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 18.</p>
                     <p>But if your hearts were reſolved indeed to forſake your ſins; they would be your hatred, and burden, and grief, and you would ſet your ſelves againſt them; but your ſtrength is too weak and diſproportionable; and hereupon you go and cry unto the Lord; O Lord, thoſe ſins are too ſtrong for me, I am not able to ſubdue

them; I beſeech thee for Chriſts ſake, to ſend forth the word of thy power, and lead captivitie captive, and ſuffer me not to diſhonour thee any more.</p>
                     <p>I ſay if your hearts were drawn into this frame; that the buſineſs did not lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deceitfulneſs or falſneſs of your hearts, but only upon the weakneſs and impotencie of your heart, (you would break down the power of ſin, but cannot do it; you would walk better with God, but you cannot do ſo) you may now go confidently unto God for ſtrength, and he will certainly hear you, and anſwer you with ſtrength in your ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>This doth ſtay and encourage us; but how may one know that it is only weakneſs, and not wickedneſs; only a want of power, and not a want of will,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Its only a weakneſs, and a want of more power againſt ſin, if you finde theſe ſix things.</p>

                     <p>If you finde theſe things in you, aſſuredly your hearts are willing to forſake ſin; and that you cannot get more riddance, doth ariſe only from weakneſs; and therefore in this caſe go to God for more of his ſtrength, and he will not deny it unto you.</p>
                     <p>And ſo for any good work that you would perform, but you cannot diſpatch it as you would, or as you ſhould; you may know that this comes only from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and defect of more ſtrength; and nor from a ſecret diſlike of it, or averſneſs unto it, if you finde theſe five qualities in you.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. You dare not neglect or omit it, but you will be doing the will of God in this and that particular dutie, with ſuch a weak power as you have, though it be in ſighs, and in tears, and in much weakneſs, and under many fears and temptations.</item>

                        <item>3. Though you cannot do much, yet you will finde deſires to do more; ſtrong cries to help weakneſs.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>Fourthly, If you would finde ſtrength from God to enable you to walk in his Statutes and to do them, then you muſt be an humble people, and you muſt ſue <note place="margin">When the heart is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> unto him <hi>in forma pauperis.</hi> Pſal 40. 17. <hi>I am poore and needy, the Lord think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon me; thou art my help, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 10. 17. <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt incline thine ear to hear.</hi> Jam. 4. 6. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</hi> By theſe places you ſee that we muſt not be proud, but humble; and if we be ſo, and if we do ſeek the Lord with an humble heart, he will hear our deſire, and will give grace unto us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps you may deſire to know <hi>when a mans heart is humble, and when he ſeeks the Lord with an humble heart, to help and ſtrengthen him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I will ſpeak a little to this: a mans heart is humble, and humbly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Firſt, He hath no ſelf-bottome to truſt unto, but looks on himſelf as one ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtitute and inſufficient; <hi>in me</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, there dwells no good;</hi> and <hi>we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, He is well contented to go abroad, and to beg, and to be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto another for all his ſupplies, and ſupports, and helps: The humble heart is well content to go and ſtand at heaven gates for mercy, for grace, for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for all ſpiritual power.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He judgeth himſelf unworthy of the leaſt mercy and help from God; not only which he hath received, (as <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32, 10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy mercies, and all the truth which thou haſt ſhewen to thy ſervant)</hi> but alſo which he doth now requeſt of God; there is no reaſon in me, nor cauſe in me, nothing in me for which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, He impleads and uſeth the name of Chriſt. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>We do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our righteouſneſs, but for thy great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of another:</hi> Gods own reaſon, for Gods own grant; for his Name ſake, for his own Promiſe ſake, for his Chriſt ſake.

                     <p>5. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The fifth and laſt Queſtion is, <hi>How one may know that God hath been his ſtrength to cauſe him to do any good work, or that he hath done it in the strength of God, and not in the ſtrength of his owne parts and gifts?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> This is a choiſe and deep queſtion, but I ſhall deſire to ſpeak a few things unto it: One may know that he doth act his duties or do his works, not in the ſtrength of his own parts, but in and by the ſtrength of God;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By the Integrity or full frame of a holy working: when his work or duty hath ſtill the requiſities that do conſtitute or make a duty to be a right duty; or a work to be a right work in a ſpiritual ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>To make a work, or to ſet forth a work in a right and ſpiritual way, there muſt be a concurrence or conjunction of five particulars.</p>

                        <item>3. There muſt be a renewed and changed heart by the ſpirit of Chriſt: the <hi>tree muſt be good, before the fruit be good.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. There muſt be the breathing of thoſe heavenly affections of love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and joy, and inward working as well as an outward work.</item>
                        <item>5. There muſt be faith to ſet it forth in the name of Chriſt.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Now to work it, I ſay,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No man on earth can (by the ſole ſtrength of his parts) ſet forth any one good work: indeed a man of much learning, and of great endowments, and of good utterance, may in the virtue of theſe ſay and do many good works, which we call good: he may make a Sermon, he may utter a Prayer, he may be much in the outward part of duty; nevertheleſs this ſtrength that is in him is nothing as to the ſpiritual performing of any duty: he is not able with all the parts which he hath, to look only at Gods glory, nor to ſet out his duties with holy and heavenly affections, nor with faith in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore if you finde this concurring frame (which! have mentioned) in any of your works or duties, aſſuredly you have attained grace and ſtrength from God to enable you: the Spirit of God hath been preſent with you to help you.</p>

                     <p>Thus have I finished the third duty, which was to depend upon God for his ſtrength, ſeeing he doth promiſe to cauſe us to walk in his Statutes and to do them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Now follows the fourth and laſt duty which concerns the people <note place="margin">Give the praiſe of all unto God.</note> of God, which is to give the praiſe of all the good which they do, unto God alone: I may not ſlightly paſs this; therefore I will enquire, firſt why, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whither.</p>
                     <p>1. Queſt. <hi>Why the people of God ſhould be carful to give unto God alone, the praiſe and glory of all the good which they do?</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Reaſons for it briefly are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, His grace is the only cauſe of all the good which we do: it is true, that we are the ſubjects who do repent, and who do believe, who do love, and
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:55323:382" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fear, and ſerve, and obey him, and walk in his Statutes: O but who is the cauſe that we do all this, or any of this? from whom is all our fruit found? Excellent is that paſſage of <hi>Auſtine, Certum eſt nos velle cum volumus, ſed Deus facit ut vellemus, certum eſt nos facere cum faciamus, Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> facit ut faciamus,</hi> we do will good, but it is God that makes us to will that good; and we do good, but it is God who makes us to do that good; it is God <hi>who works in us to will and to do:</hi> And hereupon in another place he ingenuouſly confeſſeth, that his good works were rather Gods works then his own works; <hi>Quaecunque ſunt bona opera mea tua magis quam mea ſunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if God works all our works for us, is it not juſt that he ſhould have all the glory from us?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We ſhould elſe be injurious unto God, who ſaith, <hi>Glory is mine.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 11. And <hi>my glory will I not give unto another. Eſa.</hi> 42. 8. Glory (if I may ſo ſpeak,) is the Lords portion and revenue out of all his works of power and grace; and he is very tender of it, and therefore we cheat him when we withhold any part of his glory from him; nay it is plaine theft to take any part of glory from God, unto whom all the glory doth belong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. 8. for you lay hands of that which is none of your own, and without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of another who is the true owner; and he profeſſeth that he will not part with it; it being indeed ſo properly eſſential to the crown of his diety.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We do but proudly diſhonour our ſelves, in a vain-glorious boaſting of that which is none of our own, for which God will certainly abaſe us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive?

                     <p>Fourthly, Becauſe it is an exceeding mercy, if God actually gives us his power to do any good, or to walk in his Statutes and to do them; which may appear thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is a great mercy to enjoy the Spirit of God, and an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Comfort to know that we do enjoy him: this I think no Chriſtian will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But when we finde a power enabling us to walk in Gods Statutes, this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comes from the Spirit of God dwelling in us: No man can walk in Gods Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, It is a great mercy to be made a new creature, to be regenerated, to partake of the life of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſt; whoſoever is enabled to walk in Gods ways and to do them, he is unqueſtionably a new creature, he is born again, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Chriſt, of the life of Chriſt, and hath communion with Chriſt, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in him: For <hi>without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5.) <hi>ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is a great mercy to be kept from ſin, and all ſinfull walkings by which God is diſhonoured; (therefore <hi>David</hi> abundantly bleſſed God, who kept him from ſinning againſt him, when he raſhly intended to deſtroy <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his houſhold. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, 33.) but thus are we kept and preſetved, when God cauſeth us to walk in his Statutes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is a great mercy that we are able to honour God, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our holy profeſſion: it is one of the greateſt favours which God ſhews to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man on earth, when he makes, and when he uſeth him as a veſſel of his glory.</p>
                     <p>And this honour God puts upon you, by cauſing you to walk in his Statutes;
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:55323:383"/>
now you are veſſels fitted for his honour. In theſe wayes you do live unto his honour, and to your own honour, and to the honour of your heavenly calling and profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It is a great mercy ſo to walk as to get peace in conſcience, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of happineſs: But when the Lord puts forth ſuch a power upon you, as enables you to walk in his Statutes, and to keep his judgments and to do them; hereupon,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There comes peace of Conſcience; <hi>great peace have they which keep thy law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165. And <hi>this is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our conſcience that, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And Aſſurance and confidence of happineſs; <hi>they go from ſtrength to ſtrength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God, Pſal.</hi> 44. 7.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, It is a great judgment, (yea it is one of the greateſt judgments) when the Lord leaveth any to themſelves. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 12. <hi>So I gave them up unto their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> If ſo, then by the rule of contraries, it is a very great mercy when the Lord gives unto any man the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his grace, enabling him to walk in his wayes and Statutes. Now if there be ſo many choiſe mercies beſtowed and manifeſted in cauſing us to walk in Gods Statutes, ſurely then there is great reaſon that we ſhould give God all the glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Queſt. <hi>Whether we do give God the glory of all the good which he cauſeth us</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How to know that we give God all the glory, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it not to our ſelves.</note> 
                        <hi>to do, and do not aſſert nor aſcribe it unto our ſelves?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol</hi> This may be known thus;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When we make a right diviſion of the work done by us; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make our acknowlegment; in every good work done by us, there is <hi>aliquid Dei,</hi> and <hi>aliquid mei;</hi> ſomething which is of God, and ſomething which is of our own. The goodneſs or well-doing, that is of God; and there muſt come in an <hi>Agnoſco;</hi> O Lord, this was thine, this was wrought by thee. The evil-doing, the mixtures, the imperfections, the diſtractions, theſe are ours; and here muſt come in our <hi>Ignoſce;</hi> O Lord own and accept what is thine, and O Lord merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pardon what is mine. If after any good done by us we take the humbling part unto our ſelves, and give the exalting part unto God, now we aſcribe ſhame unto our ſelves, and all the glory unto God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When after the beſt performances we ſet an higher value upon the grace of God, and do not put a higher rate upon our ſelves: as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> When aftet our good-doings, we raiſe the grace God (in this work the good hand of God was with me, and his power was manifeſted,) but we raiſe not our ſelves a jot; but we are nothing, and ſtill are nothing, and can do nothing without his grace and preſence: verily our poſture is humble, and the glory of our well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is returned to God alone.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When we are afraid of all ſelf-glory, as <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> And in the ſecret temptations unto ſelf-glory, our ſouls are diſtreſſed and exceedingly humbled within us, and we wreſtle with God to beat down, and caſt out all high ſelf-challenging, and ſelf-appropriating thoughts, and to ſet the crown of praiſe only on his own glorious name: this alſo demonſtrats that we acknowledge God, and not our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when after our well-doing our hearts do look upon the good which we have done, as ſpecial mercy which we have received, and as a new obligation binding and engageing us unto God, as for a new mercy received from the hand of God: When <hi>bona noſtra</hi> are <hi>dona ſua;</hi> our good-doings are reckoned amongſt Gods favours and mercies to us; and when we look on <hi>bona noſtra</hi> as <hi>debità no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra;</hi>
                        <pb n="731" facs="tcp:55323:383"/>
the good which we do as indebting us unto God for what he hath made us to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the more good we do, the more are we indebted for praiſes and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and ſay as <hi>David, What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me? Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. So what ſhall I render unto the Lord for all the good which he hath done? and for all the good which I have done? (which I have done by his power.) This ſhews that you deſire to give all the glory unto him.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, When there is an after-work to be done, as well as a fore-work to be done, and we are as ſerious, and careful, and watchful about this, as about that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before we perform any duty, our fore-work is by faith to look up to God for his ſtrength; and therein we ſhew our ſelves careful by the many prayers which we do put up unto him: And after we have done the duty, there is another work which doth concerne us, and that is immediate and ſolmne returnes of praiſe unto God, to give him praiſe who hath given us ſtrength, and this work fills our hearts preſently; we cannot come off from our work; we do not account all our work done, untill this be done: As when <hi>Naaman</hi> was cleanſed, he returned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently unto the Prophets houſe; or as when the Leper was healed, he preſently went back to Chriſt and gave thanks: So as ſoon as the Lord hath enabled us to do any work which he hath commanded, we preſently are filled with the ſenſe of his goodneſs, and our lips do praiſe him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have one work yet more to do; one duty more, <hi>viz.</hi> to bleſs my God who hath been my ſtrength.</p>

                     <p>3. Uſe. DOth God himſelf undertake to cauſe his people to walk in his Statutes and to do them? then here is comfort, and ſeaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing for all the people of God: Behold your work, and behold your God, and behold your ſtrength. O what a God do you ſerve! who commands your obedience, and commands alſo his own ſtrength to enable you for that obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <note place="margin">Uſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> this I command you to do, and this I will cauſe you to do; here is my precept, and there is my promiſe; here is work, and there is ſtrength. Beloved, ſtand ſtill a little and conſider of the promiſe of God here made unto you.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is a promiſe of that whereof every one of you do ſtand in need; and <note place="margin">What Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God makes.</note> you do ſtand in need of that promiſed ſtrength every day, and every houre; our bodies do not ſtand more in need of daily food, than our ſouls do of daily ſtrength from God, to do the works which he requires of us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a promiſe which extends unto every one of you who are the people of God; to the ſtrong, and to the weak: ſome promiſes do only reſpect the ſtrong Chriſtians, and ſome of them do reſpect only the weak Chriſtians; and ſome promiſes do reſpect us only for ſome particular times, and for ſome particular conditions; but this promiſe reſpects every Chriſtian, and every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in every time, and in every condition, and for every work which he is to do. Our whole life is a time of obedience; and although our conditions do alter, yet ſtill the works of obedience do continue and remaine; and in all thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for all our ſervices in thoſe conditions, doth this promiſe of help and ſtrength remaine for every Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Becauſe it is Gods promiſe, therefore God himſelf ſtands engaged unto you, and endebted unto you: you are endebted unto God for obedience, and God is endebted unto you for ſtrength and help: <hi>Promittendo ſe fecit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitorem.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <item>1. The good of the promiſe is ſutable, and anſwerable to our need.</item>

2. The performance of that promiſed good belongeth to God. <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. He is able to accompliſh it, for he is a natural alſufficiency, an infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a treaſury full of grace and power; nothing is too hard for him.</item>
                        <item>4. He will perform it, for he is faithful who hath promiſed, and will not alter the word that is come out of his lips, neither will he ſuffer his faithfulnes to faile: The heavens ſhall wax old as a garment, and the earth ſhall be changed, but his word remaines for ever: His counſel ſhall ſtand, and his truth for evermore: he cannot lye nor deny himſelf.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Fourthly, This promiſe is a bond of preſent payment: all the promiſes cannot be ſued at one time, nor at all times; but this promiſe of <hi>cauſing us to walk in his Statutes</hi> may be ſued every day, and is to ſome performed every day. The time or need is unqueſtionable the very fit time for payment, (for God to make good his promiſe;) but every day is our time of need, every time that we are to perform ſervice unto God, is God bound to perform his promiſe of help and ſtrength unto us, becauſe then we do need his preſence and aſſiſtance. Now this is a wonderful comfort unto all the people of God, whoſe hearts are made willing to ſerve him; you have a God to go unto, and you may freely and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go unto him, and he hath engaged himſelf by ſpecial promiſe unto you to be your help, and he is able and faithful, and will not miſs his day nor faile to help you in your time of need.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Nay let me adde one word more ſo your comfort; though the ſtrength which God imparts unto you to do him ſervice, be not ſo high and full as you do deſire, nevertheleſs</p>

                        <item>3. Whatſoever ſervice you do perform by the ſtrength of God, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that proportion which you have received,) God will graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it in Chriſt: if it be the work of his hands, it ſhall receive acceptance at his Throne.</item>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> But here it is objected; <hi>If God will cauſe his people (by giving them</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> The reaſon is not that God is not ready to make good his promiſe unto them, but becauſe they are not ready to make uſe of him to be their ſtrength; it doth ariſe,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Somtimes from the carleſneſs of their ſpirits, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64. 7. <hi>There is no man that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee:</hi> And <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43. 22. <hi>But thou haſt not called upon me O Jacob! but thou haſt been weary of me O Iſrael!</hi> And <hi>James</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not.</hi> Beloved, the Lord doth promiſe to give us his ſtrength, yet he will be enquired of by us to do it for us. And how muſt he be enquired of by us? even with our whole heart, not faintly, nor careleſly, but fervently, and ſeriouſly. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, and finde me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi> Did any of you in the ſenſe of your own weakneſs and inſufficiency ſeek the Lord with your heart, and with all your ſoul, but you found him to look down upon you with health and ſtrength?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Somtimes from the unbelief of their hearts: <hi>He that comes to God, muſt believe that God is; and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. But here we have often failed. <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdome, let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>Elſe let not this man think that</hi>

                        <hi>he ſhall obtaine any thing of the Lord.</hi> Why this is our way; either we ſeek not to the Lord, or we do not ſeek to him in faith: we are uſually ſo far from believing, that we are plainly unbelieving, God will not hear, God will not anſwer, God will not perform his promiſe unto us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Somtimes from impatience of heart: they will not wait upon the Lord, but will limit him, and leave him, and fling away without their anſwer, and their help. Where now lies the fault? in Gods promiſe? no, but in your own unbeliefe and impatience.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, It doth ſomtimes ariſe from the diſtempers of melancholy, which doth dead and oppreſs their ſpirits, and renders them (for the time) as uſeleſs veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, binding up not only the power of reaſon, but alſo the power of grace: yet when this winter is off, the ſpring of grace appears in ſtrength again.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It doth ſomtimes ariſe from their own folly, in weakning their own help and ſtrength; either</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. From ſpiritual pride, after ſpiritual enlargments, which God ever puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth with ſome meaſure of declining.</item>

                     <p>Fifthly, It doth ſomtimes ariſe from divine wiſdome, that we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes finde the like meaſure of aſſiſtance: by this God doth learne his people</p>
                     <p>1. That their ſtrength is not in themſelves, but only in their God.</p>
                     <p>2. That what they are, they are by his grace, and act in a proportion to his grace given and received.</p>
                     <p>3. That they ſhould not deſpaire at the greateſt ſervices; for God can then enlarge them; nor yet preſume and make nothing of the leaſt duties; for God can withdraw himſelf, and then they can do nothing.</p>
